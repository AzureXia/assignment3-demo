33177898,Increased Levels of Anxiety Among Medical and Non-Medical University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety levels within the community and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. We surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points: during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical students' anxiety levels increased with online learning. This study provides important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.",2020,Risk management and healthcare policy,Journal Article,2020,YES
33347341,Online and offline sexual harassment associations of anxiety and depression in an adolescent sample.,"The aims of this study were to study the prevalence of sexual harassment online and offline, to analyse the associations between subjection to sexual harassment and adolescents' mental health and analyse if there are any significant differences between girls and boys. We also examine if good peer-relationships interact with the associations between sexual harassment and mental health complaints. This cross-sectional study included 594 adolescents, age 12-20. Participants responded to a web survey including the self-assessment scales Revised Children´s Anxiety and Depression Scale and Beck Youth Inventories as well as subjection to online and offline sexual harassment and peer-relational quality. Linear regression analysis was used to study whether symptoms of anxiety and depression correlated to subjection to online and offline sexual harassment and peer-relational quality. We found that 48.50% of girls and 28.19% of boys reported sexual harassment victimization. Offline was the most frequently reported site of victimization. Online harassment correlated significantly with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms in girls but not boys. Offline harassment as well as online <i>and</i> offline harassment correlated significantly with increasing symptoms for both genders. Participants who reported good peer-relationships had significantly less symptoms. This study shows that sexual harassment remains a common plague for adolescents, especially for girls. Offline sexual harassment is the most common form of harassment for both genders. For girls, but not for boys, online sexual harassment correlated significantly with anxiety and depressive symptoms. A strong negative correlation between satisfaction to peer-relationships and mental health symptoms was found.",2021-Jul,Nordic journal of psychiatry,Journal Article,2021,YES
33206826,The influence of text messages and anxiety on pain perception and its impact on orthodontic patients routine.,"This prospective study aimed at assessing the effects of anxiety and a follow-up text message on pain perception after the installation of fixed orthodontic appliances and its impact on the patients' routine. The sample of this study consisted of 103 orthodontic patients, 40 males and 63 females (mean age 20.5 years), distributed in two groups: G1 (n=51), including control patients that did not receive any post-procedure communication; and G2 (n=52), including patients that received a structured text message. In baseline phase, the patients completed a questionnaire to assess their level of anxiety prior to treatment. Pain was assessed by using 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) in baseline and ten times prospectively in predetermined time points. VAS was also applied to assess the patient's routine alterations caused by the pain. All data were analyzed using ANOVA, Tukey, Mann-Whitney, t-test, chi-square and Spearman's correlation tests. All statistical tests were performed with significance level of 5%. Low-level and high-level anxiety was observed in 42.7% and 7.8% of the patients, respectively. Statistically significant correlation was observed between anxiety and pain (p< 0.05). Maximum mean pain intensity was detected in the second treatment day (G1=36.9mm and G2=26.2mm) and was significantly higher in G1. Nearly 53% of the patients in G1 reported alterations in the routine (18.8mm), while in G2 the percentage rate reached 28.8% (9.9mm) (p=0.013). Anxious patients report more pain after the installation of orthodontic appliances. Text messages were effective to reduce pain levels and to decrease the negative effects on patients' daily routine.",2020,Dental press journal of orthodontics,Journal Article,2020,YES
33372071,Which psychotherapy is effective in panic disorder? And which delivery formats are supported by the evidence? Study protocol for two systematic reviews and network meta-analyses.,"Panic disorder is among the most prevalent anxiety diseases. Although psychotherapy is recommended as first-line treatment for panic disorder, little is known about the relative efficacy of different types of psychotherapies. Moreover, there is little evidence concerning the effectiveness of different formats of major psychotherapeutic types, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). In this protocol, we present an overarching project consisting of two systematic reviews and network meta-analyses (NMA) to shed light on which psychotherapy (NMA-1), and specifically, which CBT delivery format (NMA-2) should be considered most effective for adults suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Starting from a common pool of data, we will conduct two systematic reviews and NMA of randomised controlled trials examining panic disorder. A comprehensive search will be performed in electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials-CENTRAL from database inception to 1 January 2021 to identify relevant studies. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied. Titles, abstract and-whenever necessary-full texts will be examined independently by at least two reviewers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool V.2. The primary efficacy outcome will be anxiety symptoms at study endpoint. The primary acceptability outcome will be all-cause discontinuation, as measured by the proportion of patients who had discontinued treatment for any reason at endpoint. Data will be pooled using a random-effects model. Pairwise and NMA will be conducted. No ethical approval is necessary for these two studies, as there will be no collection of primary data. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences and meetings.",2020-Dec-28,BMJ open,Journal Article,2020,YES
33143700,"Depression and cardiovascular risk-association among Beck Depression Inventory, PCSK9 levels and insulin resistance.","Depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are among the most common causes of disability in high-income countries, depression being associated with a 30% increased risk of future CV events. Depression is twice as common in people with diabetes and is associated with a 60% rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, an independent CVD risk factor. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, has been related to a large number of CV risk factors, including insulin resistance. Aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of depression could affect PCSK9 levels in a population of obese subjects susceptible to depressive symptoms and how these changes may mediate a pre-diabetic risk. In 389 obese individuals, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) was significantly associated with PCSK9 levels. For every one-unit increment in BDI-II score, PCSK9 rose by 1.85 ng/mL. Depression was associated also with the HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment index of insulin resistance), 11% of this effect operating indirectly via PCSK9. This study indicates a possible mechanism linking depression and insulin resistance, a well-known CV risk factor, providing evidence for a significant role of PCSK9.",2020-Nov-03,Cardiovascular diabetology,Journal Article,2020,YES
33240593,Freeze-like responses to pain in humans and its modulation by social context.,"Maladaptive defensive responses such as excessive avoidance behavior have received increasing attention as a main mechanism for the development and maintenance of chronic pain complaints. However, another defensive response which is commonly studied in animals as a proxy for fear is freezing behavior. No research to date has investigated human freezing behavior in the context of pain. In addition, there is an increasing realization that social context can affect pain-relevant processes such as pain experience and pain behavior but less is known about the effects of social context on defensive responses to pain. Hence, this study investigated freezing behavior and facial pain expression in the context of pain, and their modulation by social context. Healthy, pain-free participants (<i>N</i> = 39) stood on a stabilometric force platform in a threatening or safe social context, which was manipulated using angry or happy facial stimuli. In some trials, an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus; CS) predicted the occurrence of painful electrocutaneous stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; pain-US). We assessed body sway (an index of freezing), heart rate, facial pain expression, self-reported pain intensity, unpleasantness, and pain-US expectancy during the CS and the context alone (no CS). The results were mixed. Neither the anticipation of pain, nor social context affected body sway. Heart rate and painful facial expression were reduced in the threatening social context at high anxiety levels. A threatening social context also elicited higher pain-US expectancy ratings. In sum, a threatening social context increases the expectation of pain, but reduces the facial expression of pain and lowers heart rate in highly anxious individuals.",2020,PeerJ,Journal Article,2020,YES
33418377,Longitudinal course of depressive symptom severity among youths with bipolar disorders: Moderating influences of sustained attention and history of child maltreatment.,"Pediatric bipolar disorders are often characterized by disruptions in cognitive functioning, and exposure to child maltreatment (e.g., physical and sexual abuse) is associated with a significantly poorer course of illness. Although clinical and developmental research has shown maltreatment to be robustly associated with poorer cognitive functioning, it is unclear whether maltreatment and cognitive function jointly influence the clinical course of bipolar symptoms. This secondary analysis examined moderating effects of lifetime childhood physical and sexual abuse, and cognitive disruptions (sustained attention, affective information processing), on longitudinal ratings of depression symptom severity in youths from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study, examined from intake (M = 12.24 years) through age 22 (N = 198; 43.9% female; Mean age of bipolar onset = 8.85 years). A significant moderating effect was detected for sustained attention and maltreatment history. In the context of lower sustained attention, maltreatment exposure was associated with higher depression symptom severity during childhood, but not late adolescence. There was no association between maltreatment and symptom severity in the context of higher sustained attention, and no association between attention and depression symptom severity for non-maltreated youths. Depression symptom ratings at each assessment were subject to retrospective recall bias despite the longitudinal design. Cognitive assessments were administered at different ages across youths. Depressive symptoms in pediatric bipolar may be jointly moderated by impairments in attention and exposure to maltreatment. Assessment of these risks, particularly in childhood, may be beneficial for considering risk of recurrence or chronicity of depressive symptoms.",2021-Mar-01,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2021,YES
33269332,A Stepped Care Model of Patient Navigation to Enhance Engagement with Perinatal Mental Health Care.,"During the perinatal period, women are at increased risk for developing perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs). As perinatal mental health screening efforts increase, significantly more women will be identified who require mental health services. Evidence-based treatments exist, yet many women do not receive adequate care. Patient navigation (PN) offers a promising patient-centered approach to improve treatment attendance and engagement. The purpose of this study is to describe the development of a stepped care PN service at an intensive outpatient program for women with PMADs. Our experience incorporating this model of PN revealed significant features that may guide other treatment care facilities to adopt this service to increase identification and connection to care.",2020,Health equity,Journal Article,2020,YES
33240116,I Cannot Read Your Eye Expression: Suicide Attempters Have Difficulties in Interpreting Complex Social Emotions.,"<b>Background:</b> The ability to differentiate emotions in social contexts is important for dealing with challenging social situations. Suicide attempters show some difficulties in emotion recognition that may result in hypersensitivity to social stress. However, other studies on the recognition of social complex emotions found that suicide attempters have similar performances as depressed non-attempters. <b>Objectives:</b> To investigate differences in social emotion recognition in patients with current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with and without history of suicide attempt. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred and ten patients with MDE were recruited among whom 115 had lifetime history of suicide attempt (suicide attempters, SA) and 95 did not (affective controls, AC). Recognition of complex social emotions was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Emotions were separated in three valence categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and attention were measured with the National Adult Reading Task (NART) and the d2 test, respectively. <b>Results:</b> Mixed logistic regression models adjusted for sex, lifetime bipolar disorder, verbal IQ and attention showed that the RMET performance for neutral emotions was worse in the SA than AC group (OR = 0.87 [0.75, 0.99]). Furthermore, when violent/serious SA were compared to non-violent/non-serious SA and AC, the RMET neutral valence category showed a trend for group factor (<i>p</i> < 0.059) and RMET scores were lower in the violent/serious SA than AC group (OR = 0.79 [0.64, 0.96]). <b>Conclusion:</b> Recognition of neutral emotions is poor in SA and this may complicate their daily life. Interventions to improve the understanding of complex emotions may be helpful to prevent suicidal risk in patients with depression.",2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,Journal Article,2020,YES
33197840,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of personality disorder in randomised controlled trials of pharmacological interventions for adults with mood disorders.,"Personality disorder (PD) may affect the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for mood disorders, but the extent to which this occurs is uncertain. We aimed to examine the available published evidence concerning the role of PD in pharmacological treatment outcomes of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for adults with mood disorders (i.e. depressive and bipolar spectrum disorders). A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and Google Scholar databases was undertaken to identify studies of interest. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess methodological quality and risk of bias. A random effects model was utilised and statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018089279) and the protocol is published. The search yielded 11,640 studies. Subsequent to removing duplicates, 9657 studies were screened at title and abstract stage and 1456 were assessed at full-text stage. Eighteen studies met criteria for inclusion in this review. Meta-analysis did not reveal a significant difference between groups for treatment outcome (standardised mean difference 0.22 [-0.09, 0.54]; I<sup>2</sup>: 69%, p=0.17) and remission (risk ratio 0.84 [0.64, 1.11]; I<sup>2</sup>: 51%, p=0.22). This review was limited by lack of studies on bipolar disorder. PD comorbidity does not appear to affect treatment efficacy of pharmacological interventions for adults with mood disorders.",2021-Jan-15,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2021,YES
33187116,Long-Term Effects of a Cognitive Behavioral Conference Call Intervention on Depression in Non-Professional Caregivers.,"Recent evidence supports the efficacy of conference call cognitive-behavioral interventions in preventing depression in caregivers at post-intervention, but we do not know whether the results are sustained long term. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention administered by telephone conference call in preventing depression in caregivers with elevated depressive symptoms, comparing all components of the intervention versus only the behavioral ones. A randomized controlled trial was conducted using a dismantling strategy. At total of 219 caregivers were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral conference call intervention (CBCC; <i>n</i> = 69), a behavioral-activation conference call intervention (BACC; <i>n</i> = 70), or a usual care control group (CG, <i>n</i> = 80). Information was collected on depressive symptoms and depression at pre-intervention and at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months post-intervention. At 36 months, there was a reduction in depressive symptoms (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and a lower incidence of major depressive episodes in both the CBCC and BACC groups compared to CG (8.7%, 8.6%, and 33.7%, respectively). The results show that a conference call intervention was effective in the long term to prevent depression in caregivers and that the behavioral-activation component was comparable to the complete cognitive-behavioral protocol.",2020-Nov-11,International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article,2020,YES
33153220,"Mental Fatigue, But Not other Fatigue Characteristics, as a Candidate Feature of Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder in Patients with Anxiety and Mood Disorders-An Exploratory Study.","Obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is commonly associated with anxiety and mood disorders (AMDs), in which fatigue and executive dysfunction represent key symptoms. Executive dysfunction has also been demonstrated in subjects with OCPD, and is additionally found to be a cardinal feature of fatigue. This study aimed to investigate the associations between fatigue, executive dysfunction, and OCPD in patients with AMDs. In this cross-sectional study, 85 AMD patients (78% females, mean age 39 ± 11 years) were evaluated for OCPD traits by using the observer-rated Compulsive Personality Assessment Scale. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 was used to measure different aspects of fatigue, and the Trail Making Test was employed to assess executive functioning. The Hamilton rating scales were used to evaluate anxiety and depression symptoms. Controlling for potential confounders, there was a significant link between OCPD and mental fatigue (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.58; <i>p</i> = 0.033). No associations were found between the presence of OCPD and other relevant fatigue characteristics, including general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation, as well as executive functions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report associations between OCPD and mental fatigue in patients with AMDs, suggesting mental fatigue as a clinically important symptom when considering particular personality pathologies.",2020-Nov-03,International journal of environmental research and public health,Journal Article,2020,YES
33137611,Effectiveness of online psychological and psychoeducational interventions to prevent depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Although evidence exists for the efficacy of interventions to prevent depression, little is known about its prevention through online interventions. We aim to assess the effectiveness of online psychological and psychoeducational interventions to prevent depression in heterogeneous populations. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted based on literature searches in eight electronic data bases and other sources from inception to 22 July 2019. Of the 4181 abstracts reviewed, 501 were selected for full-text review, and 21 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, representing 10,134 participants from 11 countries and four continents. The pooled SMD was -0·26 (95%CI: -0·36 to -0·16; p < 0.001) and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this result. We did not find publication bias but there was substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 72%; 95%CI, 57% to 82%). A meta-regression including three variables explained 81% of the heterogeneity. Indicated prevention and interactive website delivery were statistically associated with higher effectiveness, and no association was observed with risk of bias. Online psychological and psychoeducational interventions have a small effect in reducing depressive symptoms in non-depressed and varied populations, and the quality of evidence is moderate. Given that these types of interventions are very accessible and can be applied on a wide scale, they should be further developed and implemented.

33029754,Sedentary behavior among breast cancer survivors: a longitudinal study using ecological momentary assessments.,"Sedentary behavior (SB) or any waking behavior ≤ 1.5 METs is associated with an increase in body weight and fatigue and poor quality of life among cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to explore longitudinal trends in SB using accelerometers and associated variables via ecological momentary assessments (EMA) among breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors (within 5 years post-diagnosis) were recruited for a 12-month observational study. Participants were asked to download an EMA application to their smartphones to receive prompts for 7 days and to concurrently wear an Actigraph accelerometer. Participants responded to 35 prompts during each 7-day assessment period at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Within each prompt, participants were asked questions about their current level of affect, sadness, anxiety, stress, worry and fatigue, and cancer-related symptoms (e.g., neuropathy). Twenty-two survivors (mean age = 51.5 years) were recruited and 20 participants completed the study. Mean baseline SB averaged 76.7 h/week. Univariate longitudinal models suggested higher levels of sadness, anxiety, stress, worry, and fatigue were associated with more SB while more positive affect was associated with less SB. Additionally, non-leisure context (work) was associated with more SB. Autoregressive models indicated cross-lagged effects of affective valence, fatigue, and SB. More negative affective valence and higher fatigue were associated with more SB. Reducing negative affect valence and offering non-sedentary approaches to manage fatigue may help reduce SB. Specific interventions are needed to reduce SB among cancer survivors-particularly those that target negative affect valence and fatigue.",2021-Aug,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,Journal Article,2021,YES
34901108,Association Between Obesity and Post-stroke Anxiety in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is serious psychosomatic comorbidity among patients with stroke, but whether obesity could be positively associated with PSA is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between obesity and subsequent anxiety risk in patients with stroke. A total of 441 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) onset were consecutively recruited within 7 days, and PSA and post-stroke depression (PSD) were evaluated by using a 14-item Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) at the end of 1-month follow-up. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was estimated for the incidental PSA by using logistic regression analysis. The incidence of PSA was 25.85% at the end of 1-month follow-up, with a significant difference between patients with and without abdominal obesity. Relative fat mass (RFM) and abdominal obesity were significantly associated with an elevated risk of PSA, and the crude ORs were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.08) and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.11-3.34), respectively. Even after adjustment for obesity-related risk factors and PSA-related clinical measurements, the association remained to be pronounced with abdominal obesity. However, RFM (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.06, <i>P</i> = 0.053) and abdominal obesity (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.80-2.15, <i>P</i> = 0.280) were not significantly associated with an elevated risk of PSD. Abdominal obesity was independently associated with the PSA instead of PSD, which may help predict PSA risk in clinical practice. Further prospective clinical studies with a long follow-up duration are warranted to verify this finding.",2021,Frontiers in nutrition,Journal Article,2021,YES
34749291,Potential structural trait markers of depression in the form of alterations in the structures of subcortical nuclei and structural covariance network properties.,"It has been proposed recently that major depressive disorder (MDD) could represent an adaptation to conserve energy after the perceived loss of an investment in a vital source, such as group identity, personal assets, or relationships. Energy conserving behaviors associated with MDD may form a persistent marker in brain regions and networks involved in cognition and emotion regulation. In this study, we examined whether subcortical regions and volume-based structural covariance networks (SCNs) have state-independent alterations (trait markers). First-episode drug-naïve currently depressed (cMDD) patients (N = 131), remitted MDD (RD) patients (N = 67), and healthy controls (HCs, N = 235) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subcortical gray matter volumes (GMVs) were calculated in FreeSurfer software, and group differences in GMVs and SCN were analyzed. Compared to HCs, major findings were decreased GMVs of left pallidum and pulvinar anterior of thalamus in the cMDD and RD groups, indicative of a trait marker. Relative to HCs, subcortical SCNs of both cMDD and RD patients were found to have reduced small-world-ness and path length, which together may represent a trait-like topological feature of depression. In sum, the left pallidum, left pulvinar anterior of thalamus volumetric alterations may represent trait marker and reduced small-world-ness, path length may represent trait-like topological feature of MDD.",2021,NeuroImage.

35002939,Investigation of Altered Spontaneous Brain Activities in Patients With Moyamoya Disease Using Percent Amplitude of Fluctuation Method: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic progressive cerebrovascular abnormality characterized by chronic occlusion of large intracranial vessels with smoky vascular development at the base of the skull. In patients with MMD, abnormal spontaneous brain activity would be expected. <b>Purpose:</b> To assess the brain activity changes in patients with MMD by resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), using the percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) analysis method. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A total of 17 patients with MMD (3 males and 14 females) and 17 healthy control (HC) subjects with matched gender and age were recruited for this study. We used rs-fMRI to scan all the patients with MMD. Spontaneous neural activity was evaluated using the PerAF approach. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the PerAF to distinguish patients with MMD from HCs. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) tests were performed to assess the emotional status of patients with MMD and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) was measured using high-resolution optical coherence tomography (hr-OCT). The relationship between the HADS scores, RNFLT values, and the PerAF signals was assessed using the Pearson's correlation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Compared with HCs, the PerAF signals in patients with MMD were decreased in the Frontal_Sup_Medial_R and Precentral_L, whereas those in the Caudate_L were increased. The areas under the ROC curves indicated that signals in these brain regions could distinguish between patients with MMD and HCs. The PerAF value of Frontal_Sup_Medial_R was positively correlated with the left and right eye RNFLT values and negatively correlated with the HADS scores. <b>Conclusion:</b> In patients with MMD, reduced PerAF signals in the Frontal_Sup_Medial_R, Precentral_L, and Caudate_L may be associated with psychiatric diseases including anxiety and depression and decreased RNFLT may be associated with ophthalmic complications due to the compression of terminal branches of the internal carotid artery in the retinal fiber layer. The PerAF can be used as an effective indicator of ocular complications of MMD and to study the neural mechanism underpinning emotional complications in patients with MMD.",2021,Frontiers in neurology,Journal Article,2021,YES
34986431,Combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm is predictive of sertraline metabolism in patients with major depressive disorder.,"Pharmacogenomic testing can be used to guide medication selection in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, there is no consensus on which gene or genes to consider in medication management. Here, we assessed the clinical validity of the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm to predict sertraline blood levels in a subset of patients enrolled in the Genomics Used to Improve DEpression Decisions (GUIDED) trial. Patients who reported taking sertraline within ≤2 weeks of the screening blood draw were included. All patients received combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing, which included a weighted assessment of individual phenotypes for multiple pharmacokinetic genes relevant for sertraline (CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4). Sertraline blood levels were compared between phenotypes based on: 1) the pharmacokinetic portion of the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm, and 2) individual genes. When evaluated separately, individual genes (for CYP2C19 and CYP2B6) and the combinatorial algorithm were significant predictors of sertraline blood levels. However, in multivariate analyses that included individual genes and the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm, only the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm remained a significant predictor of sertraline blood levels. These findings support the clinical validity of the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm, in that it is a superior predictor of sertraline blood levels compared to individual genes.",2022-Feb,Psychiatry research,Journal Article,2022,YES
37274432,The development of a Community Mental Health Education and Detection (CMED) tool in South Africa.,"Low demand for mental health services in sub-Saharan Africa is driven by poor mental health literacy, stigma, and poor service availability. To develop a Community Mental Health Education and Detection (CMED) Tool for adults for use by community health teams in South Africa aligned with their roles of health promotion, screening and linkage to care. Formative evaluation methods involving four processes: (1) Ongoing engagement with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health (KZN DoH) to ensure co-creation of the CMED tool and alignment with routine community health team activities; (2) Adaptation of the CMED tool from the Community Informant Detection Tool (CIDT), used to promote help-seeking of people with mental health problems in Nepal; (3) Review of the CMED vignettes and illustrations by a panel of local and international mental health care experts to establish accuracy and contextual and cultural relevance; (4) Process mapping and focus group discussions (FGDs) with community health teams in one district to establish cultural and contextual appropriateness as well as coherence and compatibility with existing community-based services. The resulting CMED tool consists of five case vignettes and related illustrations to facilitate psychoeducation and the detection of possible depression, anxiety, psychosis, harmful alcohol use, and drug use by community health teams. Based on prototype matching, it includes two structured questions to guide the community health teams in the detection and referral process. The tool was acceptable, culturally and contextually appropriate, and helpful for the services provided by community health teams. Challenges of working in households and the importance of self-care were highlighted as important considerations when developing training content and piloting the tool. Extensive consultation with the KZN DoH, community health teams, and the expert mental health panel resulted in developing a tool that was perceived to be culturally sensitive and relevant to the community package of services.",2021-Dec,SSM.

34804757,Prophylactic Administration of Alpha Blocker for the Prevention of Urinary Retention in Males Undergoing Inguinal Hernia Repair Under Spinal Anesthesia: Interim Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"This randomized controlled study aims to investigate the prophylactic effect of tamsulosin on the development of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in men undergoing elective open inguinal hernia (IH) repair under spinal anesthesia. The study also focused on potentially predisposing factors for POUR. 100 eligible patients were randomized into two groups. Patients in the experimental group were given two doses of tamsulosin 0.4 mg orally 24 hours and 6 hours before surgery. In the control group, two doses of placebo were administered, in the same manner as the study group. The following parameters were also recorded: the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire scores, the presence of scrotal hernia, operation duration, perioperative administration of IV opioids and/or atropine, postoperative pain, and preoperative anxiety. Overall, the incidence of POUR was 37% (37/100) with no difference between the two groups. Among patients receiving tamsulosin, 39.2% (20/51) developed POUR, compared to 34.7% (17/49) in the control group. Preoperative patients' high anxiety visual analog scale (VAS) score (>51mm) (P=0.007) and the intraoperative use of atropine (P=0.02) were detected as risk factors for POUR. This interim analysis of our prospective randomized trial showed no benefit from the prophylactic use of tamsulosin in preventing POUR after IH repair under spinal anesthesia. This type of anesthesia was also correlated with an overall high incidence of POUR. Preoperative anxiety and administration of atropine were identified as statistically significant factors for POUR. In patients with preoperative high anxiety, VAS score a different type of anesthesia may be used.",2021-Nov,Cureus,Journal Article,2021,YES
36845894,Non-pharmacologic interventions to improve depression and anxiety among pregnant and parenting women who use substances: An integrative literature review.,"Pregnant and parenting women who use substances report high rates of comorbid depression and anxiety. Due to the significant impact of this comorbidity on treatment adherence and maternal/child outcomes, effective psychosocial and behavioral interventions to address depression and anxiety in this population are necessary. A directed search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases produced 22 articles from 20 distinct studies examining non-pharmacologic interventions with an effect on depression and anxiety among pregnant or parenting women using substances. Of the 20 studies reviewed, 8 were randomized controlled trials, 7 were quasi-experimental studies, and 5 were cohort studies. Results revealed a wide array of interventions targeting intrapersonal, interpersonal, and/or structural factors within these women's lives. Parenting therapy and psychosocially enhanced treatment programs had the strongest evidence for positive treatment effect in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety. The use of contingency-management, case-managed care, patient or wellness navigators, mindfulness-based therapy, maternal-child relationship-focused therapy, family therapy, peer support, and therapeutic community-based interventions show promise but warrant further experimental exploration. Comprehensive and gender-specific residential treatment was observationally associated with improvements in depression and anxiety; however, the specific modality of efficacy is unclear. Future research should focus on identifying which modalities are most cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable among this uniquely vulnerable population.",2022-Mar,Drug and alcohol dependence reports,Journal Article,2022,YES
34884299,Longitudinal Analyses of the Reciprocity of Depression and Anxiety after Traumatic Brain Injury and Its Clinical Implications.,"Depression and anxiety are common following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Understanding their prevalence and interplay within the first year after TBI with differing severities may improve patients' outcomes after TBI. Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of TBI recruited for the large European collaborative longitudinal study CENTER-TBI were screened for patient-reported major depression (MD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at three, six, and twelve months post-injury (N = 1683). Data were analyzed using autoregressive cross-lagged models. Sociodemographic, premorbid and injury-related factors were examined as risk factors. 14.1-15.5% of TBI patients reported moderate to severe MD at three to twelve months after TBI, 7.9-9.5% reported GAD. Depression and anxiety after TBI presented high within-domain persistency and cross-domain concurrent associations. MD at three months post-TBI had a significant impact on GAD at six months post-TBI, while both acted bidirectionally at six to twelve months post-TBI. Being more severely disabled, having experienced major extracranial injuries, an intensive care unit stay, and being female were risk factors for more severe MD and GAD. Major trauma and the level of consciousness after TBI were additionally associated with more severe MD, whereas being younger was related to more severe GAD. Individuals after TBI should be screened and treated for MD and GAD early on, as both psychiatric disturbances are highly persistent and bi-directional in their impact. More severely disabled patients are particularly vulnerable, and thus warrant timely screening and intensive follow-up treatment.",2021-Nov-28,Journal of clinical medicine,Journal Article,2021,YES
34953030,Attenuated alpha-gamma coupling in emotional dual pathways with right-Amygdala predicting ineffective antidepressant response.,"The diversity of treatment outcomes for major depressive disorder (MDD) remains uncertain in neuropathology. The current study aimed at exploring electrophysiological biomarkers associated with treatment response. The present study recruited 130 subjects including 100 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. All subjects participated in a sad expression recognition task while their magnetoencephalography data were recorded. Patients who had a reduction of at least 50% in disorder severity at endpoint (>2 weeks) were considered as responders. Within-frequency power and phase-amplitude coupling were measured for the brain regions involved in the emotional visual information processing pathways. The significant alpha-gamma decoupling from the right thalamus to the right amygdala in unconscious processing and from right orbital frontal cortices to the right amygdala in conscious processing was found in non-responders relative to responders and healthy controls. These kinds of dysregulation could also predict the potential treatment response. The attenuated alpha-gamma coupling in dual pathways indicated increased sensitivity to the negative emotional information and reduced moderated effect of the amygdala, which might cause insensitivity to antidepressant treatment and could be regarded as potential neural mechanisms for treatment response prediction.",2022-Mar,CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,Journal Article,2022,YES
34866649,The impact of adverse childhood experiences and recent life events on anxiety and quality of life in university students.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been repeatedly associated with a wide range of physical and mental health issues. Research has indicated high levels of anxiety and depression among university students, and a few studies have documented the relationship between ACEs and anxiety in the university student population. This study surveyed first year students at a university located in the most ethnically diverse district in England, with the second highest poverty rate. Eight hundred and fifty-eight responded; a response rate of 12%. The survey included questions about adverse childhood events, recent life stressors, current deprivation, quality of life, positive physical health and positive mental health, and used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, a standardised measure. Thirty-seven percent of the responding students met the diagnosis for generalised anxiety disorder. In a multivariate multiple regression model, life stressors and childhood adversities were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of physical and mental health. Only childhood adversities significantly predicted lower levels of quality of life. The findings highlight the importance of considering adverse childhood experiences in enhancing the wellbeing of the student population. Given the demographics of the student population at the University of East London, the high rates of ACEs and anxiety are likely to partially reflect poverty and racism. The implications of the findings for trauma-informed policies and practices in universities are discussed.

35028216,"Fear, Psychological Impact, and Coping During the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Pandemic Among the General Population in India.","Introduction Public health emergencies such as pandemics affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals and societies. Thus, this study aims to better understand the fear due to coronavirus disease (COVID) and associated levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and coping in the general public of India during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and coping levels among the general population during the coronavirus pandemic's initial phase. An online survey was conducted using a snowball sampling technique. Results A total of 489 people responded to the survey. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and stress were 27.2%, 21.5%, and 15.3% respectively. Female gender, age below 35 years, history of medical or psychiatric illness, and those who had personal contact with persons with COVID-19 were significantly associated with presence of depression, anxiety, and stress whereas spending more than 1 hour on COVID-19-related information was associated with significant stress. Conclusion This study concludes that the prevalence rates of psychological problems were high during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are directly related to the fear associated with COVID-19 but had an inverse relationship with the resilient coping levels.",2021-Dec,Cureus,Journal Article,2021,YES

34910960,"Comorbid depression and obesity among adults in Germany: Effects of age, sex, and socioeconomic status.","Depression and obesity are common health problems with major public health implications. These conditions frequently co-occur, adversely affecting the course of the other. The sociodemographic and socioeconomic risk factors for comorbid depression and obesity in the German adult population have not yet been reported. We analyzed the prevalence and sociodemographic and socioeconomic correlates of comorbid depression and obesity using cross-sectional data from the national German health interview and examination survey for adults (DEGS1; n = 7987) and its mental health module (DEGS1-MH; n = 4493). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to diagnose major depressive disorder (CIDI-MDD). Sensitivity was analyzed using the self-reported depression measure and current depressive symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Obesity was defined by body mass index calculated from measured data. Prevalence of comorbid depression and obesity was 1.3% (95% CI 0.8-2.0) in men and 2.0% (95% CI 1.3-3.0) in women. We found significant sex differences in results from the self-reported depression measure and the PHQ-9, but not from the CIDI-MDD. Low socioeconomic status and poor social support were linked to a higher prevalence of comorbid depression and obesity among women. Severe depression may have been underreported. Depression is statistically more prevalent in women than in men, which accounts for many of the sex differences in the prevalence of comorbid depression and obesity in our models. Targeted public health strategies need to be developed to prevent and treat comorbid depression and obesity in women with a low socioeconomic position.",2022-Feb-15,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2022,YES
34850475,"Panic-like responses of female Wistar rats confronted by Bothrops alternatus pit vipers, or exposure to acute hypoxia: Effect of oestrous cycle.","Anxiety-related diseases are more than twice as common in women than in men, and in women, symptoms may be exacerbated during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Despite this, most research into the underlying mechanisms, which drives drug development, have been carried out using male animals. In an effort to redress this imbalance, we compared responses of male and female Wistar rats during exposure to two unconditioned threatening stimuli that evoke panic-related defensive behaviours: confrontation with a predator (Bothrops alternatus) and acute exposure to hypoxia (7% O<sub>2</sub> ). Threatened by venomous snake, male and female rats initially displayed defensive attention, risk assessment, and cautious interaction with the snake, progressing to defensive immobility to overt escape. Both males and females displayed higher levels of risk assessment but less interaction with the predator. They also spent more time in the burrow, displaying inhibitory avoidance, and more time engaged in defensive attention, and non-oriented escape behaviour. In females, anxiety-like behaviour was most pronounced in the oestrous and proestrus phases whereas panic-like behaviour was more pronounced during the dioestrus phase, particularly during late dioestrus. Acute hypoxia evoked panic-like behaviour (undirected jumping) in both sexes, but in females, responsiveness in late dioestrus was significantly greater than at other stages of the cycle. The results reveal that females respond in a qualitatively similar manner to males during exposure to naturally occurring threatening stimuli, but the responses of females is oestrous cycle dependent with a significant exacerbation of panic-like behaviour in the late dioestrus phase.",2022-Jan,The European journal of neuroscience,Journal Article,2022,YES
36184843,The role of life satisfaction in the association between problematic technology use and anxiety in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The main aim of this study is to explore problematic technology use among adolescents (Internet, video games, mobiles, and television) and its association with anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we also analysed the possible moderating role of life satisfaction in this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. A cross-sectional survey of 4025 children and adolescents (52% females and 48% males) between 12 and 18 years old was carried out to explore problematic technology use and its correlation with anxiety and life satisfaction after pandemic lockdown. Four multivariate regressions containing the independent variable (problematic technology use), the moderator (life satisfaction), and their interaction were entered to predict the outcome (anxiety). The moderated models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro software (Model 1). Analyses showed significant positive correlations with anxiety and negative correlations with life satisfaction regarding problematic technology use (mobile phone, television, and internet). Both gender and age had a significant direct effect on anxiety (showing that women and older participants had the greatest anxiety). In the moderation analysis, when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms depended to a greater extent on the problematic use of technology. Our results confirm that problematic technology use is related to higher levels of anxiety in adolescents, with differences by age and gender. The results also showed that life satisfaction mediated the relationship between technology abuse and anxiety, such that when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms was more dependent on problematic technology use. These findings have implications for health and education professionals.",2023-Feb,International journal of mental health nursing,Journal Article,2023,YES
36206887,Anticipatory cues in emotional processing shift the activation of a combined salience sensorimotor functional network in drug-naïve depressed patients.,"Major depressive disorder is characterized by a large-scale brain network dysfunction, contributing to impairments in cognitive and affective functioning. Core regions of default mode, limbic and salience networks are also impaired in emotional processing and anticipation. This study aimed to explore default mode, salience, and limbic networks modulation during the processing of emotional stimuli with and without anticipatory cues in depression, and further investigate how these networks were functionally coupled with the rest of the brain. Twenty-one drug-naïve depressed patients and 15 matched controls were included in the study. All participants completed a psychological assessment and the affective pictures paradigm during an fMRI acquisition. Group independent component analysis and psychophysiological interactions analyses were performed. A significant interaction between Cue, Valence and Group was found for the salience/sensorimotor network. When processing uncued emotional stimuli, patients showed increased activation of this network for negative vs. neutral pictures, whereas when anticipatory cues were displayed previously to the picture presentation, they invert this pattern of activation (hyperactivating the salience/sensorimotor network for positive vs. neutral pictures). Patients showed increased functional connectivity between the salience/sensorimotor network and the left amygdala as well as the right inferior parietal lobule compared to controls when processing uncued negative pictures. The sample size was modest, and the salience/sensorimotor network included regions not typically identified as part of salience network. Thus, this study should be replicated to further interpret the results. Anticipatory cues shift the pattern of activation of the salience/sensorimotor network in drug-naïve depressed patients.",2023-Jan-01,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2023,YES
36186361,The role of English as a foreign language learners' grit and foreign language anxiety in their willingness to communicate: Theoretical perspectives.,"Learners' willingness to communicate in a foreign language is regarded as a critical issue in educational contexts, so the role of emotional factors in learners' willingness to communicate has drawn the attention of investigators. This review investigated the studies on the relationship between English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' grit, foreign language anxiety, and willingness to communicate. This review showed a significant relationship between learners' grit and willingness to communicate. The earlier studies showed that gritty learners with incessant inspiring efforts are more likely to communicate in a foreign language. This review also indicated that lower anxious learners tend to have more willingness to communicate. Earlier studies also indicated that the theories, such as broaden-and-build, positive psychology, dynamic system, affective filter, and attentional control can justify the relationships between these constructs. Moreover, the study has some pedagogical implications and suggestions for teachers, learners, syllabus designers, material developers, teacher educators, policy-makers, and advisors.

36495619,Childhood abuse and cortical gray matter volume in patients with major depressive disorder.,"Childhood abuse is associated with brain structural alterations; however, few studies have investigated the association between specific types of childhood abuse and cortical volume in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to investigate the association between specific types of childhood abuse and gray matter volumes in patients with MDD. Seventy-five participants with MDD and 97 healthy controls (HCs) aged 19-64 years were included. Cortical gray matter volumes were compared between MDD and HC groups, and also compared according to exposure to each type of specific childhood abuse. Emotional, sexual, and physical childhood abuse were assessed using the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Patients with MDD showed a significantly decreased gray matter volume in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) was associated with significantly decreased gray matter volume in the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG). In the post-hoc comparison of volumes of the right ACG and MOG, MDD patients with CSA had significantly smaller volumes in the right MOG than did MDD patients without CSA or HCs. The right MOG volume decrease could be a neuroimaging marker associated with CSA and morphological changes in the brain may be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD.",2023-Jan,Psychiatry research,Journal Article,2023,YES
36711419,The positive effect of mother-performed infant massage on infantile eczema and maternal mental state: A randomized controlled trial.,"To observe the influence of MPIM on infantile eczema, quality of life, growth and maternal mental state. This trial was a randomized controlled study. Sixty-six full-term infants with eczema were randomly divided into eczema control group (EC group, <i>n</i> = 33) and eczema with MPIM group (EM group, <i>n</i> = 33), along with healthy full-term infants in the healthy control group (HC group, <i>n</i> = 31). The mothers in the EC group received the instruction of routine care, while the mothers in the EM group applied massage on the infants plus receiving the same instruction of the routine care. HC group received none of any specific intervention. Data were collected in the three groups at the baseline and at the end of 2- and 5-month intervention. Before and at the end of 2-month intervention, the following indexes were investigated in infants including the growth indexes, eczema area severity index (EASI), infantile dermatitis quality of life index (IDQOL). And the scores of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were investigated in mothers at the same timepoints. At the end of 5-month intervention, the infants' growth and relapse condition of eczema were observed. Overall, 31 cases in HC group, 31 in EC group and 32 in EM group were included for data analysis. There were no significant differences in the indexes of infantile growth among the three groups (all <i>P</i> >0.05). The scores of EASI and IDQOL significantly lowered (both <i>P</i> < 0.001) in EC group following the instruction of routine care, along with reduced maternal scores of SAS and SDS (both <i>P</i> < 0.05). Compared with the EC group, the EM group showed significantly lower scores of EASI and IDQOL (both <i>P</i> < 0.001) and lower relapse rate (<i>P</i> < 0.01) in infants with eczema, along with significantly lower scores of SAS and SDS in mothers (both <i>P</i> < 0.01). Moreover, none of obvious adverse reaction was reported following MPIM, to which most of the mothers could adhere. MPIM could effectively promote the remission of infantile eczema and reduce its relapse, along with relieving maternal anxiety and depression mood.

Although the etiology or pathophysiology of TRD remains unclear, certain clinical variables have been found to be related to its severity and prognosis. Therefore, 1151 patients with recurrent depression were recruited from the National Survey on Symptomatology of Depression (NSSD) and their depressive symptoms were assessed by using the doctor-rating assessment questionnaire. Then, the differences between patients with or without TRD were compared by parametric or nonparametric tests and the risk factors for TRD were explored by logistic regression. The results showed there were differences in clinical variables between patients with and without TRD. Additionally, we found depression with more somatic symptoms had a higher risk for TRD. Further analysis by stepwise logistic regression showed that age, gender, religious belief, drinking habit, the total course of depression, the number of hospitalizations, characteristics of seasonal episode remission, depressed mood, hypersexuality, emotionally incoherent psychotic symptoms, psychomotor agitation, respiratory system symptoms and history of suicide attempts were strongly associated with TRD.

An extensive literature review was conducted, primarily of articles searchable in PubMed, relating to psychiatric uses, safety, and adverse effects of gabapentin. Evidence supports gabapentin as a treatment for alcohol withdrawal and alcohol use disorder. There is sufficient evidence to consider gabapentin as a third-line treatment for social anxiety disorder and severe panic disorder. Evidence does not support the use of gabapentin for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), stimulant use disorder, or opioid withdrawal. Risks of gabapentin use are highest among those with a history of a substance use disorder and those concurrently taking opioids.

40477751,[Digital health literacy and well-being].,"Previous findings suggest that depressive and anxiety-related symptoms have doubled among students since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Digital health literacy can act as a protective resource to strengthen well-being. This paper analyzes the relationship between digital health literacy, socioeconomic status, well-being and future-anxiety among students in Austria. A total of 480 students from Austrian higher education institutions were surveyed via online questionnaire during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Sociodemographic data, students' self-assessments of well-being, fears about the future, and digital health literacy were collected. Variance and regression analyses were used for the evaluation. About 50% of the students reported low well-being and distinct fears about the future. Regarding digital health literacy, the ability to assess the relevance of information showed the highest correlation with well-being. A higher socioeconomic status correlated with higher well-being as well as lower fears about the future. The assessment of the relevance of information and connecting it with one's own life reality seems to be an important factor in promoting well-being.

An intervention was implemented to provide direct consultations between patients and medical physicists to reduce patient anxiety and improve patient satisfaction. A randomized clinical trial was conducted to test the intervention's effect on anxiety, distress, treatment adherence, technical understanding, and satisfaction in patients receiving radiation therapy. Eligible patients were recruited into ""intervention"" and ""standard of care"" arms within a phase 2 screening randomized trial. Intervention-arm patients met with a medical physicist who provided technical information and addressed patient questions or concerns at the time of treatment simulation and before the first treatment. In addition to baseline information collected before randomization, participants were surveyed (1) before simulation, (2) before the first treatment, and (3) before the completion of treatment to evaluate the study endpoints. Primary endpoints included patient anxiety and distress. Secondary endpoints included patient treatment adherence, overall satisfaction, and technical understanding of treatment. Patients in the intervention arm were surveyed before and after each physicist meeting. Participant anxiety was significantly reduced in the intervention arm (difference, -0.29; 95% confidence interval, -0.57 to -0.02; P = .038). No differences in distress or treatment adherence were observed between groups. Although measures of technical understanding and satisfaction were evaluated as exploratory objectives, participants in the intervention group were more likely to feel that technical aspects of treatment were adequately explained (difference, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-1.54), and all measures of technical understanding and satisfaction were considerably higher in the intervention group at the time of the first visit. The establishment of a direct patient-provider relationship with the medical physicist reduced anxiety in patients receiving radiation therapy. In addition, increases in patient understanding of the technical aspects of care and in satisfaction were observed at the initiation of treatment.",2023-Jan-01,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Journal Article,2023,YES

Therefore, the development of an instrument to capture COVID-19-related worries and fears is relevant. This study aims to develop and validate the CoV-WoFe to measure COVID-19-related worries and fears. <b>Methods:</b> An online questionnaire was completed by 593 participants during Christmas 2020 and by 328 participants during Summer 2021, from which 88 participants formed a longitudinal sample. <b>Results:</b> Analyses confirmed a robust adjustment for consistency over time and a gender-invariant bifactorial structure. Factor 1 represented worry about the health consequences of COVID-19 and Factor 2 represented the perceived physiological symptoms associated with fear of COVID-19. Construct validity was evidenced by: the expected relations between the CoV-WoFe and other theoretically related constructs; the serial mediating role of both dimensions in the relationship that security values establish with protective behaviors against COVID-19 and with anxiety; and the expected gender differences in the Cov-WoFe. <b>Conclusion:</b> The CoV-WoFe represents a short, valid, reliable, gender-invariant tool that is easy to apply in both the health professional and research context to assessCOVID-19-related worries and fears, which are variables of relevance for spread of the virus and for mental health.",2022,International journal of public health,Journal Article,2022,YES
36194458,A Video-Delivered Family Therapeutic Intervention for Perinatal Women With Clinically Significant Depressive Symptoms and Family Conflict: Indicators of Feasibility and Acceptability.,"Variation in family therapeutic intervention fidelity has an impact on outcomes. The use of video conferencing technology can strengthen therapist fidelity to family therapeutic interventions. This article explores indicators of feasibility and acceptability for a video-delivered family therapeutic intervention for perinatal women with depressive symptoms and family conflict. The objectives of this article are to describe indicators of feasibility, including therapist fidelity to the intervention and technological factors that relate to implementation of the intervention, as well as indicators of acceptability for participants of the intervention. The data included in this article are from an ongoing randomized trial of the Resilience Enhancement Skills Training (REST) video-delivered family therapeutic intervention. Participant recruitment and data collection are still underway for this clinical trial. Of the 106 participants who are currently enrolled in this study, 54 (51%) have been randomized to receive REST from May 2021 through July 2022. Currently, 2 therapists are delivering the intervention, and the training procedures for therapists are summarized herein. Therapist fidelity to the family therapeutic intervention was assessed in 67 audio recorded sessions. The training procedures were summarized for use of video conferencing technology by therapists and the 54 study participants. Knowledge of the video conferencing technology features was assessed in therapists and study participants by the number of attempts required to use the features. Participant responsiveness to the intervention was assessed by the percentage of attended sessions and percentage of complete homework assignments. To date, both therapists have demonstrated high fidelity to the family therapeutic intervention and used all video conferencing technology features on their first attempt. The current participants required 1 to 3 attempts to use 1 or more of the video conferencing technology features. About 59% (n=32) of the current participants immediately accessed the features on the first attempt. Our results show that perinatal women attended all sessions, and their family members attended 80% of the sessions. To date, participants have completed 80% of the homework assignments. These early findings describe indicators of the feasibility and acceptability of the video-delivered family therapeutic intervention for use with this high priority population. Upon completion of recruitment and data collection, a subsequent article will include a mixed methods process evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the video-delivered family therapeutic intervention.

Data collected from a sample of undergraduate students at a large Midwestern university was used to investigate these aims. This included salivary cortisol data collected over four days, scores on a measure of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression, and scores on a measure of daily hassles administered everyday for two weeks. Generalized estimating equations and multilevel modeling techniques were used to analyze data. Elevated cortisol levels during the awakening period and the evening period, lower total levels across the day, steeper diurnal slopes, and elevated levels of negative affect and physiological hyperarousal predicted experiences of daily hassles. Tripartite dimensions were unrelated to cortisol indices. The present study demonstrates the utility of modeling multiple cortisol indices and provides evidence of differential associations between physiological and phenomenological indices of stress.",2023-Jan,Biological psychology,Journal Article,2023,YES
36592864,Neuregulin-1 reverses anxiety-like behavior and social behavior deficits induced by unilateral micro-injection of CoCl<sub>2</sub> into the ventral hippocampus (vHPC).,"Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is an epidermal growth factor family member with essential roles in the developing and adult nervous systems. In recent years, establishing evidence has collectively suggested that NRG1 is a new modulator of central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, with multifaceted roles in neuroprotection, remyelination, neuroinflammation, and other repair mechanisms. NRG1 signaling exerts its effects via the tyrosine kinase receptors ErbB2-ErbB4. The NRG1/ErbB network in CNS pathology and repair has evolved, primarily in recent years. In the present study, we demonstrated that a unilateral microinjection of CoCl<sub>2</sub> into the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) induced hypoxic insult and led to anxiety-related behaviors and deficit sociability in mice. NRG1 treatment significantly alleviated the CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced increase of hypoxic-related molecules and behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, NRG1 reduced the CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal deficits in the vHPC or primary hippocampal neurons in mice.

The sample comprised 148 higher education students of the south of Portugal, being 108 (73%) female, aged between 18 and 54 years old. The measuring instrument included a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Internet Addiction Test, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Fifty-five (37.2%) students had a good sleep quality, 77 (52%) poor sleep quality, and 16 (10.8%) a severe sleep disorder. Forty-one (27.7%) students said that they went to bed between 12:00 am and 12.30 am and 37 (25%) between 11 pm and 11.30 pm. The sleep duration was 7:08±1:31. Fifty (48.1%) students who classified with poor sleep quality classified themselves as good sleepers (p≤0.001). Internet addiction was not associated with poor sleep quality. Students who present anxiety and/or depression symptoms had 0.31 (CI: 0.135-0.71; p=0.005) more probabilities to have sleep disorders compared to those who did not show these symptoms. This study found that most of the analyzed students present a poor quality of sleep and this was associated with a presence of anxiety and/or depression. It becomes necessary to develop sleep hygiene education programs for prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances in this population.",2022,Northern clinics of Istanbul,Journal Article,2022,YES
37891874,Novel Heme Oxygenase-1 Inducers Palliate Inflammatory Pain and Emotional Disorders by Regulating NLRP3 Inflammasome and Activating the Antioxidant Pathway.,"Chronic pain caused by persistent inflammation is current in multiple diseases and has a strong negative impact on society. It is commonly associated with several mental illnesses, which can exert a negative influence on pain perception, and needs to be eradicated. Nevertheless, actual therapies are not sufficiently safe and effective. Recent reports demonstrate that the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme produces analgesic effects in animals with osteoarthritis pain and reverses the grip strength loss caused by sciatic nerve crush. In this research, we evaluated the potential use of three new HO-1 inducers, 1m, 1a, and 1b, as well as dimethyl fumarate (DMF), for treating persistent inflammatory pain induced by the subplantar injection of complete Freud's adjuvant and the functional deficits and emotional sickness associated. The modulator role of these treatments on the inflammatory and antioxidant pathways were also assessed. Our findings revealed that repeated treatment, for four days, with 1m, 1a, 1b, or DMF inhibited inflammatory pain, reversed grip strength deficits, and reversed the linked anxious- and depressive-like behaviors, with 1m being the most effective. These treatments also suppressed the up-regulation of the inflammasome NLRP3 and activated the expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor and the HO-1 and superoxide dismutase 1 enzymes in the paw and/or amygdala, thus revealing the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of these compounds during inflammatory pain. Results suggest the use of 1m, 1a, 1b, and DMF, particularly 1m, as promising therapies for inflammatory pain and the accompanying functional disabilities and emotional diseases.",2023-Sep-23,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,2023,YES
37882108,Benefits of adaptive cognitive training on cognitive abilities in women treated for primary breast cancer: Findings from a 1-year randomised control trial intervention.,"While adaptive cognitive training is beneficial for women with a breast cancer diagnosis, transfer effects of training benefits on perceived and objective measures of cognition are not substantiated. We investigated the transfer effects of online adaptive cognitive training (dual n-back training) on subjective and objective cognitive markers in a longitudinal design. Women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer completed 12 sessions of adaptive cognitive training or active control training over 2 weeks. Objective assessments of working memory capacity (WMC), as well as performance on a response inhibition task, were taken while electrophysiological measures were recorded. Self-reported measures of cognitive and emotional health were collected pre-training, post-training, 6-month, and at 1-year follow-up times. Adaptive cognitive training resulted in greater WMC on the Change Detection Task and improved cognitive efficiency on the Flanker task together with improvements in perceived cognitive ability and depression at 1-year post-training. Adaptive cognitive training can improve cognitive abilities with implications for long-term cognitive health in survivorship.",2023-Dec,Psycho-oncology,Journal Article,2023,YES
38163568,Circulating mitochondrial long non-coding 7S RNA in primary health care patients with depression/anxiety.,"The significant role of long non-coding 7S RNA in controlling mitochondrial transcription highlights its importance in mitochondrial function. Considering the suggested connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and the onset of mental disorders, this study aimed to explore the potential involvement of 7S RNA in the context of depression/anxiety. A total of 181 patients in primary health care (age 20-64 years) with depression/anxiety and 59 healthy controls were included in the study. 7S RNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR in plasma samples collected before (baseline) and after 8 weeks of treatment (mindfulness or cognitive-based behavioral therapy). Upon adjustment for age and sex, the baseline plasma levels of 7S RNA were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). Notably, post-treatment, there was a significant reduction in 7S RNA levels (p = 0.03). These changes in 7S RNA were related to the treatment response, as indicated by HADS-D (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) scores (ß = -0.04, p = 0.04), even after accounting for baseline scores and other cofounders. The findings of this study indicate an association between plasma 7S RNA levels and depression/anxiety, as well as treatment response. While further confirmatory analyses are necessary, plasma 7S RNA holds promise as a potential predictive biomarker for both depression/anxiety and the treatment response within these disorders.",2024-Mar-15,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2024,YES
37981724,Psychological Health Among Older Adults During and After Quarantine: A Multi-Method Study.,"Depression among older adults is a growing problem. With aging being a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, depression in this population may have been exacerbated. This study aimed to describe experiences and changes in depressive symptoms and well-being of older adults during and after the COVID-19 first wave in Spain. The study used a multi-method design. Participants self-reported depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) and well-being (Cantril Ladder of Life). Participants were asked about changes in depressive symptoms or well-being during quarantine. If a change was perceived, they were asked to describe the change. In addition, the Patient Global Impression of Change scale was used. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on the data. 111 participants (mean age: 71±5 years; 76% women) completed the study. Sixty-three percent reported mild and 2% reported major depressive symptoms. Nearly half (47.7%) reported changes in depressive symptoms during the lockdown. While 37% reported feeling better during the lockdown, about 11% reported depressive symptoms were worse now compared with during the lockdown. 60% reported worsening well-being during the quarantining period. The qualitative analysis revealed 2 main themes: (1) psychological discomfort (mood deflection, fear/worries, and boredom/inactivity) and (2) social issues (inability to go out, missing family members and others). Worsening depressive symptoms and lowering of well-being were noticed in this sample of older adults during and post-COVID lockdowns. Evaluation of mental health in the primary care setting and providing referrals for mental health services is essential for older adults who experienced COVID-19-related lockdowns.",2024-Jan,Western journal of nursing research,Journal Article,2024,YES
38025419,The role of IL-33 in depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Depression has long been considered a disease involving immune hyperactivation. The impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 on depression has been widely studied. However, the effect of IL-33, another pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been less researched. Currently, research on the correlation between IL-33 and depression risk is inconsistent. In response to these divergent results, we conducted a review and meta-analysis aimed at resolving published research on the correlation between IL-33 and depression risk, and understanding the potential role of IL-33 in the development and treatment of depression. After searching different databases, we analyzed 8 studies. Our meta-analysis showed that IL-33 had a positive correlation with reduced risk of depression. The pooled standard mean differences (SMD) = 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.24. Subgroup analysis results showed that IL-33 and ST2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid and serum is positive correlated with reduced risk of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). According to the characteristics of the included literature, the results mainly focuses on Caucasian. Furthermore, according to the subgroup analysis of depression-related data sources for disease or treatment, the correlation between IL-33 and depression risk is reflected throughout the entire process of depression development and treatment. Therefore, the change of IL-33 level in serum and cerebrospinal fluid can serve as useful indicators for assessing the risk of depression, and the biomarker provides potential treatment strategies for reducing the burden of the disease.",2023,Frontiers in psychiatry,Journal Article,2023,YES
38247415,A Deep Learning Driven Simulation Analysis of the Emotional Profiles of Depression Based on Facial Expression Dynamics.,": Diagnosis and assessment of depression rely on scoring systems based on questionnaires, either self-reported by patients or administered by clinicians, and observation of patient facial expressions during the interviews plays a crucial role in making impressions in clinical settings. Deep learning driven approaches can assist clinicians in the course of diagnosis of depression by recognizing subtle facial expressions and emotions in depression patients. : Seventeen simulated patients who acted as depressed patients participated in this study. A trained psychiatrist structurally interviewed each participant with moderate depression in accordance with a prepared scenario and without depressive features. Interviews were video-recorded, and a facial emotion recognition algorithm was used to classify emotions of each frame. : Among seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise), sadness was expressed in a higher proportion on average in the depression-simulated group compared to the normal group. Neutral and fear were expressed in higher proportions on average in the normal group compared to the normal group. The overall distribution of emotions between the two groups was significantly different (<i>p</i> ＜ 0.001). Variance in emotion was significantly less in the depression-simulated group (<i>p</i> ＜ 0.05). : This study suggests a novel and practical approach to understand the emotional expression of depression patients based on deep learning techniques. Further research would allow us to obtain more perspectives on the emotional profiles of clinical patients, potentially providing helpful insights in making diagnosis of depression patients.",2024-Feb-29,Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Journal Article,2024,YES
37789577,Lithium in bipolar depression: A review of the evidence.,"Lithium is widely used as treatment of acute mania and as prophylactic therapy for bipolar disorder. International and national guidelines also consider lithium as a possible treatment of acute bipolar depression. Research on the use of lithium in bipolar depression, however, seems to be limited compared to the data available for its efficacy in the other phases of bipolar disorder. To provide a systematic review of the evidence for lithium in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and provide directions for further research. A systematic review of clinical studies investigating the use of lithium in bipolar depression was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines in Pubmed, Embase and Psychinfo using the medical subjects headings and free text terms ""lithium,"" ""bipolar depression,"" ""dosage,"" ""serum concentration"" and ""bipolar disorders."" This review included 15 studies with a total of 1222 patients, between the age of 18 and 65, suffering from bipolar depression of which 464 were treated with lithium. There are currently only limited and low-quality data on the efficacy of lithium as a treatment of bipolar depression. It appears that there have been no placebo controlled randomized controlled trials with lithium concentrations that are considered to be therapeutic. The older studies suffered from limitations such as small sample sizes, insufficient treatment lengths, and insufficient monitoring of serum concentrations. In contrast to data for the treatment of mania and prophylaxis, robust data on the efficacy of lithium in bipolar depression is currently lacking, making it impossible to make conclusions regarding efficacy or inefficacy, for which further research is needed.",2023-Sep,Human psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2023,YES

To examine the temporal risk patterns of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, substance use disorders, sleep disorders, somatoform/conversion disorders, and psychotic disorders, among patients with dementia before, at the time of, and after receipt of a diagnosis. This population-based, nationwide cohort study analyzed data from 796 505 participants obtained from 6 registers between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2017, including the Swedish registry for cognitive/dementia disorders. Patients with dementia were matched on year of birth (±3 years), sex, and region of residence with up to 4 controls. Data were analyzed between March 1, 2023, and August 31, 2023. Any cause of dementia and dementia subtypes. Flexible parametric survival models to determine the time-dependent risk of initial diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, from 7 years prior to dementia diagnosis to 10 years after diagnosis. Subgroup analysis was conducted for psychiatric drug use among persons receiving a diagnosis of dementia from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. Of 796 505 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 80.2 [8.3] years; 448 869 (56.4%) female), 209 245 had dementia, whereas 587 260 did not, across 7 824 616 person-years. The relative risk of psychiatric disorders was consistently higher among patients with dementia compared with control participants and began to increase from 3 years before diagnosis (hazard ratio, [HR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.67-1.76), peaked during the week after diagnosis (HR, 4.74; 95% CI, 4.21-5.34), and decreased rapidly thereafter. Decreased risk relative to controls was observed from 5 years after diagnosis (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98). The results were similar for Alzheimer disease, mixed dementia, vascular dementia and unspecified dementia. Among patients with dementia, markedly elevated use of psychiatric medications was observed in the year leading up to the dementia diagnosis and peaked 6 months after diagnosis. For example, antidepressant use was persistently higher among patients with dementia compared with controls, and the difference increased from 2 years before dementia diagnosis (15.9% vs 7.9%, P < .001), peaked approximately 6 months after dementia diagnosis (29.1% vs 9.7%, P < .001), and then decreased slowly from 3 years after diagnosis but remained higher than controls 5 years after diagnosis (16.4% vs 6.9%, P < .001). The findings of this cohort study that patients with dementia had markedly increased risks of psychiatric disorders both before and after dementia diagnosis highlight the significance of incorporating psychiatric preventative and management interventions for individuals with dementia across various diagnostic stages.",2023-Oct-02,JAMA network open,Journal Article,2023,YES
38041007,Mediation role of anxiety on social support and depression among diabetic patients in elderly caring social organizations in China during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study.,"Diabetes has become a prominent global public health problem, which is an important cause of death, disease burden, and medical and health economic burden. Previous studies have reported that majority of persons diagnosed with diabetes later presented with psychological and mental health diseases. The study aimed to explore the mediation role of anxiety on social support and depression among diabetic patents in elderly caring social organizations (SOs). A multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling method was used in this cross-sectional study, and a questionnaire consisting of demographic questionnaire, MSPSS, GAD-7, and CES-D-10 was utilized to gather data. SPSS 22.0 and MPLUS 7.4 were used for statistical analysis. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to investigate correlations of key variables. A generalized linear model was used to exam factors associated with depression. Finally, the mediation effect among study variables was investigated by structural equation modeling (SEM). The average scores of social support, anxiety, and depression were 58.41 ± 14.67, 2.95 ± 3.95, and 7.24 ± 5.53, respectively. The factors of gender, social support, and anxiety were identified as significantly influential factors related to depression among diabetic patients in elderly caring SOs. The effect of social support on depression was significantly mediated by anxiety (β = -0.467, 95%CI: -0.813 to -0.251). Furthermore, anxiety partially mediated the relationship between family support and depression (β = -0.112, 95%CI: -0.229 to -0.012), and anxiety functioned as a complete mediator in the effect of significant others' support and depression (β = -0.135, 95%CI: -0.282 to -0.024). The indirect effect of social support on depression through anxiety among diabetic patients in elderly caring SOs was elucidated. Social support played a key role in maintaining and regulating their mental health, particularly from family and significant others. Social support provided by both family and significant others exerted an important influence on maintaining and regulating their mental health. In light of this pathway, the elderly caring SOs should enhance the magnitude of social support from these two sources, thereby diminishing the likelihood of experiencing anxiety and depression.",2023-Dec-01,BMC geriatrics,Journal Article,2023,YES

39558048,Structural neural plasticity evoked by rapid-acting antidepressant interventions.,"A feature in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), a mood disorder, is the impairment of excitatory synapses in the prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, different types of treatment with fairly rapid antidepressant effects (within days or a few weeks), such as ketamine, electroconvulsive therapy and non-invasive neurostimulation, seem to converge on enhancement of neural plasticity. However, the forms and mechanisms of plasticity that link antidepressant interventions to the restoration of excitatory synaptic function are still unknown. In this Review, we highlight preclinical research from the past 15 years showing that ketamine and psychedelic drugs can trigger the growth of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal neurons. We compare the longitudinal effects of various psychoactive drugs on neuronal rewiring, and we highlight rapid onset and sustained time course as notable characteristics for putative rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, we consider gaps in the current understanding of drug-evoked in vivo structural plasticity. We also discuss the prospects of using synaptic remodelling to understand other antidepressant interventions, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally, we conclude that structural neural plasticity can provide unique insights into the neurobiological actions of psychoactive drugs and antidepressant interventions.",2025-Feb,Nature reviews.

40226675,The Pathologic Roles and Therapeutic Implications of Ghrelin/GHSR System in Mental Disorders.,"Ghrelin is a hormone consisting of 28 amino acids. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a receptor for ghrelin, which is expressed in the brain, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, especially in the hypothalamus. The binding of ghrelin to the receptor 1a subtype mediates most of the biological effects of ghrelin. Ghrelin has a close relationship with the onset of psychosis. Ghrelin can affect the onset of psychosis by regulating neurotransmitters such as dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, brain-gut axis, the mesolimbic dopamine system, and other ways. Ghrelin activates neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) through the GHSR. Ghrelin binds to neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where it promotes the activity of dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAcs) in a GHSR-dependent way, increasing dopamine levels and the reward system. This article summarized the recent research progress of ghrelin in depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa (AN), and bulimia nervosa (BN), and emphasized its potential application for psychiatric disorders treatment.",2024,Depression and anxiety,Journal Article,2024,YES
39412694,The Impact of a Creativity Camp Intervention on Depression and Well-Being in Adolescents.,"Depression is a serious public health problem that often emerges during adolescence. Many adolescents do not respond to standard treatments, necessitating the development of novel interventions. We conducted a preliminary study to assess the impact of a novel creative arts intervention on depression and well-being in adolescents. In this quasi-experimental study, 69 adolescents 12-17 years completed an 8-day ""Creativity Camp"" intervention encompassing multiple creative activities. Self-report questionnaires to measure depression, anxiety, and well-being were administered at five time points to allow examination of change across multiple temporal segments: the 2 weeks before the intervention, the 2 weeks during the intervention, the 2 weeks after the intervention, and the 6 months after the intervention. Adolescents were assigned to one of two groups to compare changes observed during the 2 week before-intervention period (Group A) to the changes observed during the intervention period (pre-post intervention) (Group B). According to both parent and child reports, pre-to-post-intervention, mean adolescent depressive symptoms significantly decreased, and these changes were sustained 2 weeks after the intervention and (according to parents) at the 6-month follow-up. There was preliminary evidence for improved well-being at post-intervention. Comparison of Group A's changes during the before-intervention period to Group B's changes pre-post intervention was significant for parent-reported depression. Preliminary evidence suggests that the Creativity Camp intervention may positively impact adolescent depression and well-being. This evidence highlights the importance of investigating and implementing treatment approaches focusing on creative arts for adolescents with depression.",2024-Oct-16,Child psychiatry and human development,Journal Article,2024,YES

The relationship between the severity of depression symptoms and intake of total cereals, vegetables, and fruits dietary fiber was assessed using both univariate and multivariate linear/logistic regression analyses. Stratified analyses were conducted based on hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cancer or malignancy, and cardiovascular disease. <b>Results:</b> This study included 28,852 participants who were classified into 21,696 with nondepression symptoms, 4614 with mild depression symptoms, 1583 with moderate depression symptoms, 684 with moderately severe depression symptoms, and 275 with severe depression symptoms. After adjusting all confounding factors, we observed a negative correlation between total dietary fiber and depression symptoms (beta = -0.004, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: -0.006, -0.002). Taking nondepression symptoms as a reference, total dietary fiber was found to have an inverse association with moderate (OR = 0.976, 95% CI: 0.962-0.991), moderately severe (OR = 0.963, 95% CI: 0.938-0.990), and severe depression symptoms (OR = 0.960, 95% CI: 0.921-1.001; marginal significance), respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The intakes of total dietary fibers might be related to moderate/moderately severe/severe depression symptoms, and a negative association was shown between total dietary fiber intakes and the risk of depression symptoms.",2024,Behavioural neurology,Journal Article,2024,YES
39700437,CAMONCO 2: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Open Dialogue About Complementary Alternative Medicine and Standard Care on Patients' Quality of Life.,"This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the impact of OD-CAM on patients' quality of life (QoL), emotional well-being, decision regret, and survival. Patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment were randomly allocated to receive standard care (SC) plus OD-CAM or SC alone. The primary end point was patient-reported QoL 8 weeks after enrollment. Secondary end points included patient-reported QoL, anxiety, depression, and decision regret at 12 and 24 weeks after enrollment and overall survival at 52 weeks after enrollment. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Computer Adaptive Test Core questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, and the Decision Regret Scale. A total of 210 patients were equally randomly assigned, leaving 105 patients in each group. No significant differences were observed in QoL, well-being, decision regret, or survival between the groups. OD-CAM did not demonstrate superiority over SC in enhancing the QoL and well-being of patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment. Increased levels of anxiety and fatigue might result from OD-CAM, underscoring the importance of the person-oriented approach inherent in OD-CAM. OD-CAM may hold clinical significance, especially for those already inclined toward CAM; however, further investigation into the essential components of OD-CAM and the characteristics of patients who are most likely to experience significant improvements of OD-CAM is recommended.",2024-Dec-19,JCO oncology practice,Journal Article,2024,YES
39638054,"Exploring the associations between the presence, characteristics, and biopsychosocial covariates of pain and lifetime depression in adolescents: A cross-sectional ABCD study analysis.","Depression and pain co-occur, even during adolescence. However, there is limited knowledge on the association between pain and lifetime depression, and which biopsychosocial measures are associated with this co-occurrence. Cross-sectional analysis of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) two-year follow-up. We explored associations between the presence and characteristics of past month pain (intensity, duration, activity limitations, and number of pain sites) and lifetime depression using logistic regression. We explored associations of brain structure, physical, behavioural, emotional, social, and cognitive measures with lifetime depression and past month pain compared to having had one or neither condition using multinomial logistic regression. A total of 5211 adolescents (mean age = 12.0 years) who had: (1) no lifetime mental ill-health and no pain (n = 3327); (2) pain only (n = 1407); (3) lifetime depressive disorder but no pain (n = 272); and (4) lifetime depressive disorder and pain (n = 205) were included. Pain presence was associated with lifetime depression (OR[95%CI]: 1.76 [1.45, 2.13], p < 0.001). Pain-related activity limitations (1.13 [1.06, 1.21], p < 0.001) and the number of pain sites (1.06 [1.02, 1.09], p < 0.001) were associated with lifetime depression. Various behavioural, emotional, social, and cognitive, but not brain structure or physical measures, were associated with lifetime depression and past month pain. Longitudinal analyses should validate prognostic markers for predicting co-occurring depression and pain. Results support an association between the presence and characteristics of pain and lifetime depression during adolescence and could indicate the need for more integrated recognition and clinical care of youth experiencing both depression and pain.",2025-Mar-01,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2025,YES
40086912,Effectiveness of enhanced group cognitive behaviour therapy for older adults (CBT-OA) with depression and anxiety: A replication study.,"Enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for older adults (CBT-OA) modifies standard CBT to better address the needs of older adults, considering age-related impacts on learning. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Cassidy's manualized CBT-OA protocol (Cassidy, 2016a, 2016b) for late-life depression or anxiety in a larger sample at a different center. This retrospective observational study used a within-subject pre-/post-data design to evaluate the CBT-OA group for seniors with depression or anxiety. Outcome measure were compared before and after the CBT-OA intervention. A post-hoc analysis examined differential effects of age ('young-old' versus 'old-old'). CBT-OA groups were held in an urban, community-based geriatric psychiatry outpatient setting from 2015-2019. The analysis included forty community-dwelling outpatients over 65 years old with symptoms of late-life depression and/or anxiety. Cassidy's manualized CBT-OA protocol for late-life depression or anxiety was used. Five CBT-OA series were held, each lasting 7-9 weeks (average of 8 weeks) with 2-h weekly sessions, involving 6-9 participants per series. Outcome measures included the self-reported Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Perceived Quality of Life Questionnaire. CBT-OA significantly improved mood, anxiety, and perceived quality of life, with the greatest gains in 'young-old' participants. This first replication study of Cassidy's CBT-OA protocol for late-life depression or anxiety showed similar positive findings. Future research should use a randomized-controlled design to examine CBT-OA's efficacy, considering different age groups, longer-term follow-up, and well-being measures aligned with positive psychiatry.",2025-Mar,International psychogeriatrics,Journal Article,2025,YES
39642469,Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program for reducing anxiety and depression in hospital staff during a pandemic: A randomized controlled trial.,"Hospital staff have experienced an increase in psychopathological symptoms such as anxiety or depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the aims of the present research were, firstly, to study the effectiveness of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program in reducing psychopathological symptoms in hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as, its effectiveness in increasing mindfulness-related skills, self-compassion, body awareness, and reducing stress levels. This parallel randomized controlled trial consisted of 97 hospital workers who were divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 54) and the control group (n = 44). To test the efficacy of the program, participants' levels of psychopathological symptoms, mindfulness-related skills, self-compassion, body awareness, and stress were assessed and compared before and after the intervention. The results show a significant group × time interaction and significant differences in somatizations (p = .03; η<sup>2</sup>p = .047), depression (p = .01; η<sup>2</sup>p = .103) and anxiety (p = .02; η<sup>2</sup>p = .054). As well as in the following secondary outcomes: from the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire: Observing (p = .001; η<sup>2</sup>p = .176), acting with awareness (p = .01; η<sup>2</sup>p = .151), nonjudging; (p = .01; η<sup>2</sup>p = .103) and nonreactivity (p = .02; η<sup>2</sup>p = .101). In the Self-Compassion Scale: self-kindness (p = .029; η<sup>2</sup>p = .049), mindfulness (p = .033; η<sup>2</sup>p = .047), self-judgment (p = .016; η<sup>2</sup>p = .060) and isolation (p = .025; η<sup>2</sup>p = .051. And finally, in the Body awareness subscale from Self-Body Connection (p = .044; η<sup>2</sup>p = .042). These results highlight the importance of providing hospital staff with skills that help them connect in the present with their feelings and thoughts, without judgment and with self-compassion, to protect them from suffering an increase in their symptoms of somatization, anxiety, and depression, in adverse times like a pandemic.",2025-Jan,Journal of psychiatric research,Journal Article,2025,YES
40010905,A Pilot Open Trial of a Text Message Safety Behavior Fading Intervention for Appearance Concerns Among Women.,"Appearance concerns are a key feature in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, and they have been found to be a common feature of social anxiety disorder. Given the lack of transdiagnostic treatments for appearance concerns, we developed a preliminary text-based intervention targeting appearance-related safety behaviors (ARSBs; i.e., maladaptive behavioral strategies that seek to mitigate the feared consequences of the evaluation of appearance). The intervention utilized a daily text-message protocol where individuals are asked to fade their behaviors, provided encouragement, and log ARSB use in the past day. We evaluated the efficacy of ARSB fading in two successive cohorts of women with elevated appearance concerns (Study 1 N = 38, Study 2 N = 39). We found that across both studies participants experienced large reductions in appearance concerns (d = .93-1.36) and eating disorder symptoms (d = 1.06-1.20) that were maintained 1 month after treatment. Further, participants experienced small-to-medium reductions in social anxiety (d = 0.38-0.58) and depression (d = 0.52-0.96) from pre- to posttreatment. Notably, there were missing data in both studies (31%-50%), but multiple imputation was used to observe stability of effects. We also collected and incorporated feedback on the treatment to optimize the treatment before conducting the second trial. While these changes did not lead to significant differences in study outcomes, the second cohort demonstrated greater adherence to treatment and found the treatment to be more credible than the first cohort. Further, we found that greater baseline ARSBs predicted greater pre- to follow-up changes in appearance concerns. Taken together, text-based ARSB fading appears to be a promising treatment, and further research on the treatment appears warranted.",2025-Mar,Behavior therapy,Journal Article,2025,YES
39354998,Academic and non-academic predictors of common mental health difficulties among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Public concern for the mental health of university students has been rising over recent years. Newly arising stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to further mental health burden for students. This study aimed to understand the mental health status of university students at an early stage in the pandemic and to identify academic, non-academic, and COVID-19-related predictors of common mental health difficulties at this time. This study examined how academic and non-academic predictors relate to common mental health difficulties using a cross-sectional sample of university students (<i>n</i> = 3817). There were high levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs. Academic stress, social isolation, intolerance of uncertainty, and more negative attitudes towards remote teaching and learning predicted higher levels of depression and anxiety. University identification predicted lower levels of depression whereas receiving a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of depression. This study identified COVID-19-related factors that uniquely contributed to students' distress during the pandemic, over and above social connectivity variables. As COVID-19 factors, such as the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, may have driven an increase in distress levels among students, these findings provide insights that could help universities and policymakers develop targeted interventions to support the mental health and well-being of university students during future crises.",2024,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2024,YES
39623741,Comparison of the Incidence and Magnitude of Hyponatremia Among Patients With Poststroke Depression Receiving Either Escitalopram or Sertraline.,"Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition experienced in stroke survivors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used as first-line antidepressants; however, they have been strongly associated with hyponatremia which, in poststroke patients, can worsen outcomes. This study aims to determine and compare the incidence and magnitude of hyponatremia and potential risk factors in patients receiving either escitalopram or sertraline for the management of poststroke depression (PSD). A retrospective observational study involving all hospitalized patients who received either escitalopram or sertraline for the treatment of PSD. Electronic medical records were reviewed over a 5-year period with data collected on various demographic, laboratory, comorbidity, and medication-related variables. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 401 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 36.7% of patients experienced hyponatremia, with 67 (38.3%) cases in patients receiving escitalopram and 76 (33.6%) in sertraline group. The median drop in sodium level from baseline was 5 mmol/L in both groups; with the majority of cases being of mild nature (73.1% and 69.7% for escitalopram and sertraline, respectively). Findings from the multivariate logistic regression did not yield a model with significant association (p = 0.353). Escitalopram and sertraline were both associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia in poststroke patients, with most cases being mild. There was no significant difference between treatment arms regarding the incidence or magnitude of hyponatremia. Caution should be exercised when prescribing escitalopram or sertraline.",2024-Dec,Pharmacology research & perspectives,Journal Article,2024,YES
