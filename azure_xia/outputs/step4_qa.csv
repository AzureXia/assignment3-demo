33177898,Increased Levels of Anxiety Among Medical and Non-Medical University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety levels within the community and in particular medical students who are already considered psychologically vulnerable groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, no study has yet estimated the effect of this pandemic on university students in the UAE or its impact on the psychological well-being of medical students. We surveyed 1485 medical (comprising medical and dental) and non-medical university students across 4 emirates within the UAE. We used an online platform to assess knowledge, sources of information, changes in hygienic behavior, perceptions of fear and worry and anxiety levels using the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. The GAD-7 score was measured at three time points: during hospital visits for medical/dental students, before the introduction of online learning and after online learning for all students. The majority of students demonstrated high levels of knowledge and utilized reliable sources of information. Non-medical students exercised higher compliance with social restrictions, while medical students practiced better hand hygiene. Almost half of students reported anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe with females reporting higher anxiety scores during hospital visits (OR=2.02, 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.91) and medical students reporting lower anxiety levels in comparison to dental students (OR=0.61, 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84). Medical students reported higher levels of anxiety during their clinical rotations which decreased with the introduction of online learning, yet, non-medical students' anxiety levels increased with online learning. This study provides important information on the initial response and anxiety levels in university students across the UAE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from our study can be used to support the development of effective screening strategies and interventions to build psychological resilience among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergencies in the future.",2020,Risk management and healthcare policy,Journal Article,2020,YES,"### Structured Summary:

33347341,Online and offline sexual harassment associations of anxiety and depression in an adolescent sample.,"The aims of this study were to study the prevalence of sexual harassment online and offline, to analyse the associations between subjection to sexual harassment and adolescents' mental health and analyse if there are any significant differences between girls and boys. We also examine if good peer-relationships interact with the associations between sexual harassment and mental health complaints. This cross-sectional study included 594 adolescents, age 12-20. Participants responded to a web survey including the self-assessment scales Revised Children´s Anxiety and Depression Scale and Beck Youth Inventories as well as subjection to online and offline sexual harassment and peer-relational quality. Linear regression analysis was used to study whether symptoms of anxiety and depression correlated to subjection to online and offline sexual harassment and peer-relational quality. We found that 48.50% of girls and 28.19% of boys reported sexual harassment victimization. Offline was the most frequently reported site of victimization. Online harassment correlated significantly with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms in girls but not boys. Offline harassment as well as online <i>and</i> offline harassment correlated significantly with increasing symptoms for both genders. Participants who reported good peer-relationships had significantly less symptoms. This study shows that sexual harassment remains a common plague for adolescents, especially for girls. Offline sexual harassment is the most common form of harassment for both genders. For girls, but not for boys, online sexual harassment correlated significantly with anxiety and depressive symptoms.

33206826,The influence of text messages and anxiety on pain perception and its impact on orthodontic patients routine.,"This prospective study aimed at assessing the effects of anxiety and a follow-up text message on pain perception after the installation of fixed orthodontic appliances and its impact on the patients' routine. The sample of this study consisted of 103 orthodontic patients, 40 males and 63 females (mean age 20.5 years), distributed in two groups: G1 (n=51), including control patients that did not receive any post-procedure communication; and G2 (n=52), including patients that received a structured text message. In baseline phase, the patients completed a questionnaire to assess their level of anxiety prior to treatment. Pain was assessed by using 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) in baseline and ten times prospectively in predetermined time points. VAS was also applied to assess the patient's routine alterations caused by the pain. All data were analyzed using ANOVA, Tukey, Mann-Whitney, t-test, chi-square and Spearman's correlation tests. All statistical tests were performed with significance level of 5%. Low-level and high-level anxiety was observed in 42.7% and 7.8% of the patients, respectively. Statistically significant correlation was observed between anxiety and pain (p< 0.05). Maximum mean pain intensity was detected in the second treatment day (G1=36.9mm and G2=26.2mm) and was significantly higher in G1. Nearly 53% of the patients in G1 reported alterations in the routine (18.8mm), while in G2 the percentage rate reached 28.8% (9.9mm) (p=0.013).

33372071,Which psychotherapy is effective in panic disorder? And which delivery formats are supported by the evidence? Study protocol for two systematic reviews and network meta-analyses.,"Panic disorder is among the most prevalent anxiety diseases. Although psychotherapy is recommended as first-line treatment for panic disorder, little is known about the relative efficacy of different types of psychotherapies. Moreover, there is little evidence concerning the effectiveness of different formats of major psychotherapeutic types, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). In this protocol, we present an overarching project consisting of two systematic reviews and network meta-analyses (NMA) to shed light on which psychotherapy (NMA-1), and specifically, which CBT delivery format (NMA-2) should be considered most effective for adults suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Starting from a common pool of data, we will conduct two systematic reviews and NMA of randomised controlled trials examining panic disorder. A comprehensive search will be performed in electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials-CENTRAL from database inception to 1 January 2021 to identify relevant studies. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied. Titles, abstract and-whenever necessary-full texts will be examined independently by at least two reviewers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool V.2. The primary efficacy outcome will be anxiety symptoms at study endpoint. The primary acceptability outcome will be all-cause discontinuation, as measured by the proportion of patients who had discontinued treatment for any reason at endpoint. Data will be pooled using a random-effects model. Pairwise and NMA will be conducted. No ethical approval is necessary for these two studies, as there will be no collection of primary data.

33143700,"Depression and cardiovascular risk-association among Beck Depression Inventory, PCSK9 levels and insulin resistance.","Depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are among the most common causes of disability in high-income countries, depression being associated with a 30% increased risk of future CV events. Depression is twice as common in people with diabetes and is associated with a 60% rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, an independent CVD risk factor. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a key regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, has been related to a large number of CV risk factors, including insulin resistance. Aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of depression could affect PCSK9 levels in a population of obese subjects susceptible to depressive symptoms and how these changes may mediate a pre-diabetic risk. In 389 obese individuals, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) was significantly associated with PCSK9 levels. For every one-unit increment in BDI-II score, PCSK9 rose by 1.85 ng/mL. Depression was associated also with the HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment index of insulin resistance), 11% of this effect operating indirectly via PCSK9.

33240593,Freeze-like responses to pain in humans and its modulation by social context.,"Maladaptive defensive responses such as excessive avoidance behavior have received increasing attention as a main mechanism for the development and maintenance of chronic pain complaints. However, another defensive response which is commonly studied in animals as a proxy for fear is freezing behavior. No research to date has investigated human freezing behavior in the context of pain. In addition, there is an increasing realization that social context can affect pain-relevant processes such as pain experience and pain behavior but less is known about the effects of social context on defensive responses to pain. Hence, this study investigated freezing behavior and facial pain expression in the context of pain, and their modulation by social context. Healthy, pain-free participants (<i>N</i> = 39) stood on a stabilometric force platform in a threatening or safe social context, which was manipulated using angry or happy facial stimuli. In some trials, an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus; CS) predicted the occurrence of painful electrocutaneous stimulus (unconditioned stimulus; pain-US). We assessed body sway (an index of freezing), heart rate, facial pain expression, self-reported pain intensity, unpleasantness, and pain-US expectancy during the CS and the context alone (no CS). The results were mixed. Neither the anticipation of pain, nor social context affected body sway. Heart rate and painful facial expression were reduced in the threatening social context at high anxiety levels. A threatening social context also elicited higher pain-US expectancy ratings. In sum, a threatening social context increases the expectation of pain, but reduces the facial expression of pain and lowers heart rate in highly anxious individuals.",2020,PeerJ,Journal Article,2020,YES,"### Summary of Main Findings:

1. **Causes/Triggers/Risk Factors**: The study suggests that a threatening social context can influence pain-related processes, particularly in individuals with high anxiety levels. It highlights the role of social context in modulating defensive responses to pain, specifically freezing behavior and facial pain expression.

2. **Population/Demographic**: The population studied consists of healthy, pain-free participants (N = 39).

33418377,Longitudinal course of depressive symptom severity among youths with bipolar disorders: Moderating influences of sustained attention and history of child maltreatment.,"Pediatric bipolar disorders are often characterized by disruptions in cognitive functioning, and exposure to child maltreatment (e.g., physical and sexual abuse) is associated with a significantly poorer course of illness. Although clinical and developmental research has shown maltreatment to be robustly associated with poorer cognitive functioning, it is unclear whether maltreatment and cognitive function jointly influence the clinical course of bipolar symptoms. This secondary analysis examined moderating effects of lifetime childhood physical and sexual abuse, and cognitive disruptions (sustained attention, affective information processing), on longitudinal ratings of depression symptom severity in youths from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study, examined from intake (M = 12.24 years) through age 22 (N = 198; 43.9% female; Mean age of bipolar onset = 8.85 years). A significant moderating effect was detected for sustained attention and maltreatment history. In the context of lower sustained attention, maltreatment exposure was associated with higher depression symptom severity during childhood, but not late adolescence. There was no association between maltreatment and symptom severity in the context of higher sustained attention, and no association between attention and depression symptom severity for non-maltreated youths. Depression symptom ratings at each assessment were subject to retrospective recall bias despite the longitudinal design. Cognitive assessments were administered at different ages across youths. Depressive symptoms in pediatric bipolar may be jointly moderated by impairments in attention and exposure to maltreatment. Assessment of these risks, particularly in childhood, may be beneficial for considering risk of recurrence or chronicity of depressive symptoms.",2021-Mar-01,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2021,YES,"### Structured Summary:

33240116,I Cannot Read Your Eye Expression: Suicide Attempters Have Difficulties in Interpreting Complex Social Emotions.,"<b>Background:</b> The ability to differentiate emotions in social contexts is important for dealing with challenging social situations. Suicide attempters show some difficulties in emotion recognition that may result in hypersensitivity to social stress. However, other studies on the recognition of social complex emotions found that suicide attempters have similar performances as depressed non-attempters. <b>Objectives:</b> To investigate differences in social emotion recognition in patients with current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with and without history of suicide attempt. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred and ten patients with MDE were recruited among whom 115 had lifetime history of suicide attempt (suicide attempters, SA) and 95 did not (affective controls, AC). Recognition of complex social emotions was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Emotions were separated in three valence categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and attention were measured with the National Adult Reading Task (NART) and the d2 test, respectively. <b>Results:</b> Mixed logistic regression models adjusted for sex, lifetime bipolar disorder, verbal IQ and attention showed that the RMET performance for neutral emotions was worse in the SA than AC group (OR = 0.87 [0.75, 0.99]). Furthermore, when violent/serious SA were compared to non-violent/non-serious SA and AC, the RMET neutral valence category showed a trend for group factor (<i>p</i> < 0.059) and RMET scores were lower in the violent/serious SA than AC group (OR = 0.79 [0.64, 0.96]). <b>Conclusion:</b> Recognition of neutral emotions is poor in SA and this may complicate their daily life. Interventions to improve the understanding of complex emotions may be helpful to prevent suicidal risk in patients with depression.",2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,Journal Article,2020,YES,"### Structured Summary:

33197840,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of personality disorder in randomised controlled trials of pharmacological interventions for adults with mood disorders.,"Personality disorder (PD) may affect the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for mood disorders, but the extent to which this occurs is uncertain. We aimed to examine the available published evidence concerning the role of PD in pharmacological treatment outcomes of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for adults with mood disorders (i.e. depressive and bipolar spectrum disorders). A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and Google Scholar databases was undertaken to identify studies of interest. Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess methodological quality and risk of bias. A random effects model was utilised and statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018089279) and the protocol is published. The search yielded 11,640 studies. Subsequent to removing duplicates, 9657 studies were screened at title and abstract stage and 1456 were assessed at full-text stage. Eighteen studies met criteria for inclusion in this review. Meta-analysis did not reveal a significant difference between groups for treatment outcome (standardised mean difference 0.22 [-0.09, 0.54]; I<sup>2</sup>: 69%, p=0.17) and remission (risk ratio 0.84 [0.64, 1.11]; I<sup>2</sup>: 51%, p=0.22).

33029754,Sedentary behavior among breast cancer survivors: a longitudinal study using ecological momentary assessments.,"Sedentary behavior (SB) or any waking behavior ≤ 1.5 METs is associated with an increase in body weight and fatigue and poor quality of life among cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to explore longitudinal trends in SB using accelerometers and associated variables via ecological momentary assessments (EMA) among breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer survivors (within 5 years post-diagnosis) were recruited for a 12-month observational study. Participants were asked to download an EMA application to their smartphones to receive prompts for 7 days and to concurrently wear an Actigraph accelerometer. Participants responded to 35 prompts during each 7-day assessment period at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Within each prompt, participants were asked questions about their current level of affect, sadness, anxiety, stress, worry and fatigue, and cancer-related symptoms (e.g., neuropathy). Twenty-two survivors (mean age = 51.5 years) were recruited and 20 participants completed the study. Mean baseline SB averaged 76.7 h/week. Univariate longitudinal models suggested higher levels of sadness, anxiety, stress, worry, and fatigue were associated with more SB while more positive affect was associated with less SB. Additionally, non-leisure context (work) was associated with more SB. Autoregressive models indicated cross-lagged effects of affective valence, fatigue, and SB. More negative affective valence and higher fatigue were associated with more SB. Reducing negative affect valence and offering non-sedentary approaches to manage fatigue may help reduce SB.

34901108,Association Between Obesity and Post-stroke Anxiety in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is serious psychosomatic comorbidity among patients with stroke, but whether obesity could be positively associated with PSA is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential association between obesity and subsequent anxiety risk in patients with stroke. A total of 441 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) onset were consecutively recruited within 7 days, and PSA and post-stroke depression (PSD) were evaluated by using a 14-item Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) and 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) at the end of 1-month follow-up. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was estimated for the incidental PSA by using logistic regression analysis. The incidence of PSA was 25.85% at the end of 1-month follow-up, with a significant difference between patients with and without abdominal obesity. Relative fat mass (RFM) and abdominal obesity were significantly associated with an elevated risk of PSA, and the crude ORs were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.08) and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.11-3.34), respectively. Even after adjustment for obesity-related risk factors and PSA-related clinical measurements, the association remained to be pronounced with abdominal obesity. However, RFM (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.99-1.06, <i>P</i> = 0.053) and abdominal obesity (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.80-2.15, <i>P</i> = 0.280) were not significantly associated with an elevated risk of PSD.

34749291,Potential structural trait markers of depression in the form of alterations in the structures of subcortical nuclei and structural covariance network properties.,"It has been proposed recently that major depressive disorder (MDD) could represent an adaptation to conserve energy after the perceived loss of an investment in a vital source, such as group identity, personal assets, or relationships. Energy conserving behaviors associated with MDD may form a persistent marker in brain regions and networks involved in cognition and emotion regulation. In this study, we examined whether subcortical regions and volume-based structural covariance networks (SCNs) have state-independent alterations (trait markers). First-episode drug-naïve currently depressed (cMDD) patients (N = 131), remitted MDD (RD) patients (N = 67), and healthy controls (HCs, N = 235) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subcortical gray matter volumes (GMVs) were calculated in FreeSurfer software, and group differences in GMVs and SCN were analyzed. Compared to HCs, major findings were decreased GMVs of left pallidum and pulvinar anterior of thalamus in the cMDD and RD groups, indicative of a trait marker. Relative to HCs, subcortical SCNs of both cMDD and RD patients were found to have reduced small-world-ness and path length, which together may represent a trait-like topological feature of depression.

35002939,Investigation of Altered Spontaneous Brain Activities in Patients With Moyamoya Disease Using Percent Amplitude of Fluctuation Method: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic progressive cerebrovascular abnormality characterized by chronic occlusion of large intracranial vessels with smoky vascular development at the base of the skull. In patients with MMD, abnormal spontaneous brain activity would be expected. <b>Purpose:</b> To assess the brain activity changes in patients with MMD by resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), using the percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) analysis method. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A total of 17 patients with MMD (3 males and 14 females) and 17 healthy control (HC) subjects with matched gender and age were recruited for this study. We used rs-fMRI to scan all the patients with MMD. Spontaneous neural activity was evaluated using the PerAF approach. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the PerAF to distinguish patients with MMD from HCs. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) tests were performed to assess the emotional status of patients with MMD and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) was measured using high-resolution optical coherence tomography (hr-OCT). The relationship between the HADS scores, RNFLT values, and the PerAF signals was assessed using the Pearson's correlation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Compared with HCs, the PerAF signals in patients with MMD were decreased in the Frontal_Sup_Medial_R and Precentral_L, whereas those in the Caudate_L were increased. The areas under the ROC curves indicated that signals in these brain regions could distinguish between patients with MMD and HCs. The PerAF value of Frontal_Sup_Medial_R was positively correlated with the left and right eye RNFLT values and negatively correlated with the HADS scores. <b>Conclusion:</b> In patients with MMD, reduced PerAF signals in the Frontal_Sup_Medial_R, Precentral_L, and Caudate_L may be associated with psychiatric diseases including anxiety and depression and decreased RNFLT may be associated with ophthalmic complications due to the compression of terminal branches of the internal carotid artery in the retinal fiber layer.

Sertraline blood levels were compared between phenotypes based on: 1) the pharmacokinetic portion of the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm, and 2) individual genes. When evaluated separately, individual genes (for CYP2C19 and CYP2B6) and the combinatorial algorithm were significant predictors of sertraline blood levels. However, in multivariate analyses that included individual genes and the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm, only the combinatorial pharmacogenomic algorithm remained a significant predictor of sertraline blood levels.

The current study aimed at exploring electrophysiological biomarkers associated with treatment response. The present study recruited 130 subjects including 100 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. All subjects participated in a sad expression recognition task while their magnetoencephalography data were recorded. Patients who had a reduction of at least 50% in disorder severity at endpoint (>2 weeks) were considered as responders. Within-frequency power and phase-amplitude coupling were measured for the brain regions involved in the emotional visual information processing pathways. The significant alpha-gamma decoupling from the right thalamus to the right amygdala in unconscious processing and from right orbital frontal cortices to the right amygdala in conscious processing was found in non-responders relative to responders and healthy controls. These kinds of dysregulation could also predict the potential treatment response.

Despite this, most research into the underlying mechanisms, which drives drug development, have been carried out using male animals. In an effort to redress this imbalance, we compared responses of male and female Wistar rats during exposure to two unconditioned threatening stimuli that evoke panic-related defensive behaviours: confrontation with a predator (Bothrops alternatus) and acute exposure to hypoxia (7% O<sub>2</sub> ). Threatened by venomous snake, male and female rats initially displayed defensive attention, risk assessment, and cautious interaction with the snake, progressing to defensive immobility to overt escape. Both males and females displayed higher levels of risk assessment but less interaction with the predator. They also spent more time in the burrow, displaying inhibitory avoidance, and more time engaged in defensive attention, and non-oriented escape behaviour. In females, anxiety-like behaviour was most pronounced in the oestrous and proestrus phases whereas panic-like behaviour was more pronounced during the dioestrus phase, particularly during late dioestrus. Acute hypoxia evoked panic-like behaviour (undirected jumping) in both sexes, but in females, responsiveness in late dioestrus was significantly greater than at other stages of the cycle. The results reveal that females respond in a qualitatively similar manner to males during exposure to naturally occurring threatening stimuli, but the responses of females is oestrous cycle dependent with a significant exacerbation of panic-like behaviour in the late dioestrus phase.",2022-Jan,The European journal of neuroscience,Journal Article,2022,YES,"### Structured Summary:

Furthermore, we also analysed the possible moderating role of life satisfaction in this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. A cross-sectional survey of 4025 children and adolescents (52% females and 48% males) between 12 and 18 years old was carried out to explore problematic technology use and its correlation with anxiety and life satisfaction after pandemic lockdown. Four multivariate regressions containing the independent variable (problematic technology use), the moderator (life satisfaction), and their interaction were entered to predict the outcome (anxiety). The moderated models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro software (Model 1). Analyses showed significant positive correlations with anxiety and negative correlations with life satisfaction regarding problematic technology use (mobile phone, television, and internet). Both gender and age had a significant direct effect on anxiety (showing that women and older participants had the greatest anxiety). In the moderation analysis, when life satisfaction was higher, the presence of anxiety symptoms depended to a greater extent on the problematic use of technology. Our results confirm that problematic technology use is related to higher levels of anxiety in adolescents, with differences by age and gender.

Core regions of default mode, limbic and salience networks are also impaired in emotional processing and anticipation. This study aimed to explore default mode, salience, and limbic networks modulation during the processing of emotional stimuli with and without anticipatory cues in depression, and further investigate how these networks were functionally coupled with the rest of the brain. Twenty-one drug-naïve depressed patients and 15 matched controls were included in the study. All participants completed a psychological assessment and the affective pictures paradigm during an fMRI acquisition. Group independent component analysis and psychophysiological interactions analyses were performed. A significant interaction between Cue, Valence and Group was found for the salience/sensorimotor network. When processing uncued emotional stimuli, patients showed increased activation of this network for negative vs. neutral pictures, whereas when anticipatory cues were displayed previously to the picture presentation, they invert this pattern of activation (hyperactivating the salience/sensorimotor network for positive vs. neutral pictures). Patients showed increased functional connectivity between the salience/sensorimotor network and the left amygdala as well as the right inferior parietal lobule compared to controls when processing uncued negative pictures. The sample size was modest, and the salience/sensorimotor network included regions not typically identified as part of salience network.

It is commonly associated with several mental illnesses, which can exert a negative influence on pain perception, and needs to be eradicated. Nevertheless, actual therapies are not sufficiently safe and effective. Recent reports demonstrate that the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme produces analgesic effects in animals with osteoarthritis pain and reverses the grip strength loss caused by sciatic nerve crush. In this research, we evaluated the potential use of three new HO-1 inducers, 1m, 1a, and 1b, as well as dimethyl fumarate (DMF), for treating persistent inflammatory pain induced by the subplantar injection of complete Freud's adjuvant and the functional deficits and emotional sickness associated. The modulator role of these treatments on the inflammatory and antioxidant pathways were also assessed. Our findings revealed that repeated treatment, for four days, with 1m, 1a, 1b, or DMF inhibited inflammatory pain, reversed grip strength deficits, and reversed the linked anxious- and depressive-like behaviors, with 1m being the most effective. These treatments also suppressed the up-regulation of the inflammasome NLRP3 and activated the expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor and the HO-1 and superoxide dismutase 1 enzymes in the paw and/or amygdala, thus revealing the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of these compounds during inflammatory pain.

37981724,Psychological Health Among Older Adults During and After Quarantine: A Multi-Method Study.,"Depression among older adults is a growing problem. With aging being a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, depression in this population may have been exacerbated. This study aimed to describe experiences and changes in depressive symptoms and well-being of older adults during and after the COVID-19 first wave in Spain. The study used a multi-method design. Participants self-reported depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) and well-being (Cantril Ladder of Life). Participants were asked about changes in depressive symptoms or well-being during quarantine. If a change was perceived, they were asked to describe the change. In addition, the Patient Global Impression of Change scale was used. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on the data. 111 participants (mean age: 71±5 years; 76% women) completed the study. Sixty-three percent reported mild and 2% reported major depressive symptoms. Nearly half (47.7%) reported changes in depressive symptoms during the lockdown. While 37% reported feeling better during the lockdown, about 11% reported depressive symptoms were worse now compared with during the lockdown. 60% reported worsening well-being during the quarantining period.

Previous studies have reported that majority of persons diagnosed with diabetes later presented with psychological and mental health diseases. The study aimed to explore the mediation role of anxiety on social support and depression among diabetic patents in elderly caring social organizations (SOs). A multi-stage stratified cluster random sampling method was used in this cross-sectional study, and a questionnaire consisting of demographic questionnaire, MSPSS, GAD-7, and CES-D-10 was utilized to gather data. SPSS 22.0 and MPLUS 7.4 were used for statistical analysis. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to investigate correlations of key variables. A generalized linear model was used to exam factors associated with depression. Finally, the mediation effect among study variables was investigated by structural equation modeling (SEM). The average scores of social support, anxiety, and depression were 58.41 ± 14.67, 2.95 ± 3.95, and 7.24 ± 5.53, respectively. The factors of gender, social support, and anxiety were identified as significantly influential factors related to depression among diabetic patients in elderly caring SOs. The effect of social support on depression was significantly mediated by anxiety (β = -0.467, 95%CI: -0.813 to -0.251). Furthermore, anxiety partially mediated the relationship between family support and depression (β = -0.112, 95%CI: -0.229 to -0.012), and anxiety functioned as a complete mediator in the effect of significant others' support and depression (β = -0.135, 95%CI: -0.282 to -0.024). The indirect effect of social support on depression through anxiety among diabetic patients in elderly caring SOs was elucidated. Social support played a key role in maintaining and regulating their mental health, particularly from family and significant others.

39558048,Structural neural plasticity evoked by rapid-acting antidepressant interventions.,"A feature in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), a mood disorder, is the impairment of excitatory synapses in the prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, different types of treatment with fairly rapid antidepressant effects (within days or a few weeks), such as ketamine, electroconvulsive therapy and non-invasive neurostimulation, seem to converge on enhancement of neural plasticity. However, the forms and mechanisms of plasticity that link antidepressant interventions to the restoration of excitatory synaptic function are still unknown. In this Review, we highlight preclinical research from the past 15 years showing that ketamine and psychedelic drugs can trigger the growth of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal neurons. We compare the longitudinal effects of various psychoactive drugs on neuronal rewiring, and we highlight rapid onset and sustained time course as notable characteristics for putative rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, we consider gaps in the current understanding of drug-evoked in vivo structural plasticity. We also discuss the prospects of using synaptic remodelling to understand other antidepressant interventions, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

40226675,The Pathologic Roles and Therapeutic Implications of Ghrelin/GHSR System in Mental Disorders.,"Ghrelin is a hormone consisting of 28 amino acids. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a receptor for ghrelin, which is expressed in the brain, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, especially in the hypothalamus. The binding of ghrelin to the receptor 1a subtype mediates most of the biological effects of ghrelin. Ghrelin has a close relationship with the onset of psychosis. Ghrelin can affect the onset of psychosis by regulating neurotransmitters such as dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, brain-gut axis, the mesolimbic dopamine system, and other ways. Ghrelin activates neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) through the GHSR. Ghrelin binds to neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where it promotes the activity of dopamine neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAcs) in a GHSR-dependent way, increasing dopamine levels and the reward system.

39700437,CAMONCO 2: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Open Dialogue About Complementary Alternative Medicine and Standard Care on Patients' Quality of Life.,"This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the impact of OD-CAM on patients' quality of life (QoL), emotional well-being, decision regret, and survival. Patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment were randomly allocated to receive standard care (SC) plus OD-CAM or SC alone. The primary end point was patient-reported QoL 8 weeks after enrollment. Secondary end points included patient-reported QoL, anxiety, depression, and decision regret at 12 and 24 weeks after enrollment and overall survival at 52 weeks after enrollment. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Computer Adaptive Test Core questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, and the Decision Regret Scale. A total of 210 patients were equally randomly assigned, leaving 105 patients in each group. No significant differences were observed in QoL, well-being, decision regret, or survival between the groups. OD-CAM did not demonstrate superiority over SC in enhancing the QoL and well-being of patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment. Increased levels of anxiety and fatigue might result from OD-CAM, underscoring the importance of the person-oriented approach inherent in OD-CAM. OD-CAM may hold clinical significance, especially for those already inclined toward CAM; however, further investigation into the essential components of OD-CAM and the characteristics of patients who are most likely to experience significant improvements of OD-CAM is recommended.",2024-Dec-19,JCO oncology practice,Journal Article,2024,YES,"### Structured Summary:

40010905,A Pilot Open Trial of a Text Message Safety Behavior Fading Intervention for Appearance Concerns Among Women.,"Appearance concerns are a key feature in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, and they have been found to be a common feature of social anxiety disorder. Given the lack of transdiagnostic treatments for appearance concerns, we developed a preliminary text-based intervention targeting appearance-related safety behaviors (ARSBs; i.e., maladaptive behavioral strategies that seek to mitigate the feared consequences of the evaluation of appearance). The intervention utilized a daily text-message protocol where individuals are asked to fade their behaviors, provided encouragement, and log ARSB use in the past day. We evaluated the efficacy of ARSB fading in two successive cohorts of women with elevated appearance concerns (Study 1 N = 38, Study 2 N = 39). We found that across both studies participants experienced large reductions in appearance concerns (d = .93-1.36) and eating disorder symptoms (d = 1.06-1.20) that were maintained 1 month after treatment. Further, participants experienced small-to-medium reductions in social anxiety (d = 0.38-0.58) and depression (d = 0.52-0.96) from pre- to posttreatment. Notably, there were missing data in both studies (31%-50%), but multiple imputation was used to observe stability of effects. We also collected and incorporated feedback on the treatment to optimize the treatment before conducting the second trial. While these changes did not lead to significant differences in study outcomes, the second cohort demonstrated greater adherence to treatment and found the treatment to be more credible than the first cohort. Further, we found that greater baseline ARSBs predicted greater pre- to follow-up changes in appearance concerns.
