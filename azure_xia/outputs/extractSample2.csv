38090695,Overcoming treatment gaps in the management of depression with non-pharmacological adjunctive strategies.,"There is considerable evidence that simple, cost-effective, non-pharmaceutical strategies can be readily implemented to improve outcomes in the treatment of depression. It is estimated that 4.4% of the world's population suffers from depression. Despite being a major public health concern and the availability of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, many depressed people remain undiagnosed and receive no or inappropriate treatment. Several possible underlying factor of treatment gap can be identified in relation to pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of depression, including side effects, partial remission, treatment-resistant depression and the limited availability of psychotherapy. In addition to developing new therapeutic options, much more could be done to optimise the use of existing therapies, including combining available drug treatments with quick, simple and cost-effective non-pharmacological methods: low-intensity psychological interventions, online self-help tools and lifestyle medicine. In addition to increasing the effectiveness of treatments, prevention is equally important: awareness programs to further reduce the treatment gap, and community dissemination of the life skills that help maintain positive mental health.",2023,Frontiers in psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,YES,"### Summary:

**Main Findings:**
1. **Causes/Triggers/Risk Factors**:

     - Low-intensity psychological interventions
     - Online self-help tools
     - Lifestyle medicine
   - Prevention strategies include awareness programs and teaching life skills for maintaining mental health.
4. **Outcomes/Effects Measured**:
   - Improvements in treatment effectiveness.
   - Reduction in the treatment gap through prevention and awareness efforts.

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:

1. **Identify Causes/Triggers/Risk Factors**:
   - The article discusses issues contributing to the treatment gap in depression, such as side effects from medications, difficulties achieving remission, treatment resistance, and limited access to psychotherapy. These are indirect causes or barriers that exacerbate depression.

2. **Determine Population in Focus**:
   - The abstract states that depression impacts 4.4% of the global population and does not narrow its focus to a specific demographic group (e.g., adolescents, older adults). Therefore, I concluded that the population is general.

3. **Extract Information on Interventions/Treatments**:
   - Non-pharmaceutical interventions are highlighted, including low-intensity psychological interventions, online tools, and lifestyle changes. The abstract emphasizes combining these methods with existing pharmacological treatments to enhance outcomes. Prevention strategies, like mental health awareness programs and life skill education, are also mentioned.

4. **Find Outcomes/Evidence Mentioned**:
   - The abstract suggests that the interventions aim to improve the overall effectiveness of treatments and address the treatment gap. Additionally, prevention strategies aim to promote positive mental health and reduce undiagnosed cases.

5. **Omission Handling**:
   - If the abstract had omitted the population, interventions, or outcomes, I would explicitly note these gaps. However, sufficient information on these aspects was provided.

By synthesizing all this information, the structured summary captures the essence of the abstract without assuming data not explicitly stated.",
32387133,N<sup>6</sup>-Methyladenosine Modification of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Messenger RNA in Circular RNA STAG1-Regulated Astrocyte Dysfunction and Depressive-like Behaviors.,"N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant epigenetic modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs and is essential for multiple RNA processing events in physiological and pathological processes. However, precisely how m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is involved in major depressive disorder (MDD) is not fully understood. Circular RNA STAG1 (circSTAG1) was screened from the hippocampus of chronic unpredictable stress-treated mice using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Microinjection of circSTAG1 lentivirus into the mouse hippocampus was used to observe the role of circSTAG1 in depression. Sucrose preference, forced swim, and tail suspension tests were performed to evaluate the depressive-like behaviors of mice. Astrocyte dysfunction was examined by GFAP immunostaining and 3D reconstruction. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequence analysis was used to identify downstream targets of circSTAG1/ALKBH5 (alkB homolog 5) axis. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate astrocyte viability in¬†vitro. circSTAG1 was significantly decreased in the chronic unpredictable stress-treated mouse hippocampus and in peripheral blood of patients with MDD. Overexpression of circSTAG1 notably attenuated astrocyte dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable stress. Further examination indicated that overexpressed circSTAG1 captured ALKBH5 and decreased the translocation of ALKBH5 into the nucleus, leading to increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) messenger RNA and degradation of FAAH in astrocytes with subsequent attenuation of depressive-like behaviors and astrocyte loss induced by corticosterone in¬†vitro. Our findings dissect the functional link between circSTAG1 and m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in the context of MDD, providing evidence that circSTAG1 may be a novel therapeutic target for MDD.",2020-Sep-01,Biological psychiatry,,YES,"### Structured Summary:
1. **Causes, Triggers, or Risk Factors:**
   - Decreased levels of circular RNA STAG1 (**circSTAG1**) in the hippocampus and peripheral blood are linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). 
   - Chronic stress and corticosterone-induced astrocyte dysfunction are key contributors to depressive-like behaviors.
   - Dysregulated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation, particularly involving the degradation of FAAH messenger RNA in astrocytes, is implicated in MDD mechanisms.

2. **Population/Demographic:**
   - The study focuses on two populations: mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (animal model for MDD) and humans diagnosed with MDD (via peripheral blood analysis).

3. **Interventions/Treatments:**
   - Overexpression of circSTAG1 through lentiviral microinjection into mouse hippocampus reduced depressive-like behaviors and astrocyte dysfunction.
   - circSTAG1 appears to target m<sup>6</sup>A methylation pathways by interacting with ALKBH5 (an RNA demethylase), influencing FAAH mRNA stability and astrocyte viability.

4. **Outcomes/Effects:**
   - Positive effects include attenuated depressive-like behaviors (as measured by sucrose preference, forced swim, and tail suspension tests) and reduced astrocyte dysfunction/loss.
   - Overexpression of circSTAG1 restored astrocyte health and altered m<sup>6</sup>A methylation, providing evidence for its therapeutic potential.

### Chain of Thought Reasoning:
#### Step 1: Parse the abstract for causes or triggers of MDD.
- The abstract describes decreased levels of circSTAG1 in chronic stress-exposed mouse brains and human blood as a contributing factor to depression. Chronic unpredictable stress and corticosterone are identified as biochemical triggers leading to astrocyte dysfunction, which is tied to depressive-like behaviors. Dysregulation of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is presented as another mechanistic contributor.

#### Step 2: Identify the population studied.
- The abstract mentions two populations:
  1. Mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress, a well-established animal model for inducing depressive-like behaviors.
  2. Humans diagnosed with MDD, where peripheral blood samples were analyzed to confirm decreased circSTAG1 levels.

#### Step 3: Review for interventions or treatments.
- Overexpression of circSTAG1 (via lentiviral microinjection into the mouse hippocampus) is explicitly described as an intervention. The therapeutic mechanism involves altering m<sup>6</sup>A methylation by interacting with ALKBH5, which regulates FAAH mRNA degradation and subsequent astrocyte health.

#### Step 4: Examine the measured outcomes.
- Behavioral outcomes in mice include improvements in sucrose preference, forced swim, and tail suspension tests‚Äîall standard measures of depression-like behaviors.
- Cellular outcomes involve attenuated astrocyte dysfunction and loss.
- Molecular outcomes include increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation, decreased FAAH mRNA levels, and improved astrocyte viability in vitro.

#### Step 5: Compile the findings into a structured summary.
- Synthesizing from the above, the abstract reveals circSTAG1 as a key player in suppressing depressive-like behaviors and astrocyte dysfunction, highlights its therapeutic potential, and ties mechanistic insights to m<sup>6</sup>A methylation.

#### Step 6: Address unmentioned components.
- The abstract does not specify additional demographics, such as age or any other specific human subgroup in the study of MDD. Furthermore, no mention of standard pharmacological treatments or comprehensive human clinical trials is noted.",2020
